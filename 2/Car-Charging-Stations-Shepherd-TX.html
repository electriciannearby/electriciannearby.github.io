<p>One of the black wires receives power from the service panel; the other sends it on to other loads on the circuit. If you are noticing things like warm outlets or seeing signs of a wiring problem, you may need to quickly turn off your home's electricity. It's also important to note that kitchens should always be wired with ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlets to prevent accidental electric shocks. We service both new construction and existing structures needing electrical repair or being remodeled.</p>

Fees for services, feeders and circuits operating at over 250 volts shall be double those listed in items 2 and 3 above.
