Some common sense safety precautions include making sure your hands are dry and not standing in water when performing electrical work or when accessing your electrical panel. We want all our customers to stay safe when using electricity, whether at your home, farm or office. We don't have a qualified or licensed electrician in our company hence I'm trying to get mine so i can do installation as well.</p>
<p>Because there's little risk of electric shock, Hart says he likes to turn the lights on while installing low-voltage systems. To keep appliances safe, research the wattage requirements and electrical loads before powering them up through a generator. To do this, you will need to briefly touch together specific pairs of the wires: touch the common wire (typically white or yellow) to the ON wire (typically red) to turn the light ON. Next touch the common wire to the OFF wire (typically black) to turn the light OFF.</p>
<p>If you're adding lights at the same time you're doing new landscaping, it can cost less for the lights. The big distinction is that residential electricians work in buildings that are residences, single-family homes and small apartment buildings. Lighting not only represents the image of your company, but it enhances business and minimizes liability when in peak operating condition. Pros: Portable generators are cheaper to buy and install than home standby models.</p>

Electrical Contractor License: You need to address the Construction Contractors Board to get this license that is issued to firms or individuals. When more power is needed to meet your electrical demands the only option is upgrading electrical service.
