<h3>Lighting Repairs & Installation High Ridge MO 63049</h3>
<p>A power surge, which is also called transient voltage, is basically an increase in voltage that's above the normal level of electricity flow. While a surge will not necessarily severely damage or destroy a piece of equipment right on the spot, it can peck on it for a very long time and eventually cause problems serious enough for you to notice. These lights are solar-powered and have an integrated light sensor so they turn on automatically at night and off when the sun comes up in the morning.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, you'll want to have wiring that is long enough to extend 3 inches outside of the electrical box. For example, for an installation where you would want to hide wires behind a wall, the wires could be surrounded by insulation, creating a warmer environment. Circuit breakers provide the same type of time-delay features that equal-size time-delay fuses provide. Because a light switch is indeed switching a hot wire to the light, you've got power at the switch location.</p>
