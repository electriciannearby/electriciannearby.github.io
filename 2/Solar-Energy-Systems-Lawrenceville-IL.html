Surge protectors provide you with more electrical outlets as well as protect electrical appliances from surges. The phase or line conductors are looped either in switchboard or box and neutrals are looped either in switchboard or from light or fan. Get the plates detached by a certified electrician in case tiling is being performed around the light fittings or switches.</p>
