<p>When it's time to replace your electrical panel, our services are just a tap away. Older homes' electrical panels often top out at 60 or 100 amps, but most newer homes have 200-amp panels that meet your family's electricity needs now with plenty of room for future growth. The voltage drop in the main power wires from the generation source or the battery to the bus should not exceed 2 percent of the regulated voltage, when the generator is carrying rated current or the battery is being discharged at the 5-minute rate.</p>
<p>Test the lights; if they work correctly, bury the cable. Your family's safety is the utmost important factor to consider when deciding on whether or not to upgrade your home's electrical wiring.
