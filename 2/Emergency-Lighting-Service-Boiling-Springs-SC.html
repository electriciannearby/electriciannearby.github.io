<p>These fuse boxes worked fine for small homes that didn't use much electricity, but today's electrical usage (with air conditioners, furnaces, and so on) require a higher electrical capacity. The entire fixture is constructed of 100% brass with a removable mounting bracket increasing its uses for small, hard to light spots such as under railings or up-lighting rafters. The outlet has 2 white wires, 2 red wires and 2 black wires attached. These homeowners often don't notice the many advantages of proper lighting until the lights become dim or go out entirely.</p>
<p>In the most basic of terms, when a home backup generator system senses a power outage it will make the automatic transfer in a matter of seconds to ensure that all electrical circuits are powered normally. From 2003 - 2007, 53% of electrical failure home fires involved other known types of equipment. The constant plugging and unplugging of appliances into outlets and turning lights on and off cause wear and tear over time. We'll take care of your fuse box or malfunctioning electrical panel as fast as we can without sacrificing your family's safety.</p>
