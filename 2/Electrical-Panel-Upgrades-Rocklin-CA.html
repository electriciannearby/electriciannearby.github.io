<h3>Rocklin CA Commercial Electrical Contractors</h3>
<p>As defined by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) , a ''relay'' is "a device that is operated by a variation in the conditions of one electric circuit to affect the operation of other devices in the same or another electric circuit." A ''contactor'', on the other hand, is "a device for repeatedly establishing and interrupting an electric power circuit." It is important to recognize the difference between the two, noting particularly that the relay, serving a secondary role, causes other devices to function, whereas the contactor is the primary unit, doing its work in the main power circuit.</p>

Common types of surge protection devices include whole-house, point-of-use and uninterruptible power supplies (UPS).</p>
<p>So if you are replacing an older, existing switched outlet, and if it has 2-wire cable between the outlet and the switch, then the white wire is being used as either a permanent hot or as the switched power and IS NOT neutral. If your current line can hold 150-amps, you might want to consider that if your budget cannot handle nearly $5,000 for the upgrade to 200-amp service. The licensed electricians of MB Heating & Cooling help you determine the right size generator that is capable of powering you through a utility outage.</p>
