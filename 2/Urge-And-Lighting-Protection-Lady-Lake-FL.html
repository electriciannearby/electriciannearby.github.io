You need an electrical licence before you can do any electrical wiring work in NSW, regardless of the cost of the work and regardless of whether the work is residential, commercial or industrial.</p>
<p>Circular saws, drills, power sanders, and other electrically powered tools can deliver nasty shocks or burns Protect yourself by practicing proper electrical safety: Periodically inspect the cords and plugs on all power tools or extension cords, and avoid using any tool if the cord shows signs of fraying, nicks, cuts, cracks, or burns.
