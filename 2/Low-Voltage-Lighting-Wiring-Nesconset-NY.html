Sometimes, power interruptions could be out of faulty electrical wiring or any disturbances in the power lines, from the generators to the complex system of transformers and outlets. Besides being hazardous, having tangled cables and wires can make it harder to be productive. As a consequence, circuit breakers are slow acting, and often will not trip with a slight trickle of power to ground.</p>
<p>From appliances to communication equipment and lighting, a home generator system that provides backup electricity can help to alleviate the stress associated with losing power at the most inappropriate time.

<p>Permanent home standby generators - depending on the configuration and model - are mostly built to have an auto-transfer switch that recognizes interruption in the power supply and provides power to home appliances, including air-conditioning systems.
