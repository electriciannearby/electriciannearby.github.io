Power strips or extension cords are often used to allow several different electrical items to pull power from one outlet. 1 out of 5 Easy Digging shallow trenches for the low-voltage cable takes some work, but installing the light fixtures is a piece of cake. Even if you're a skilled DIYer, consult with a professional before installing new wiring or electrical appliances.</p>

One way you might be able to save money on the upkeep and recurring costs of your system is to use solar-powered lights.</p>

Make sure your property is prepared for a power outage by installing a backup generator.</p>
<p>Check that all appliances and electric equipment are located away from the sink and bath. We can help you do this when you call us to learn more about the generators we can install for you. Low-Voltage Lighting. Because of a circuit breaker's time-delay feature, it may not need to trip for months, even years on circuits with light loads. This poses a safety issue because many old circuit breakers won't trip when they are called upon to. This could be a potential fire hazard as heat builds up possibly breaking down components of your wiring and leading to a fire.</p>
<p>Further, appliances that have moving parts like fans and pumps consume a lot of electricity at startup but do not require a lot of power to continue functioning. Lawnmowers and hedge cutters can cut through their own electrical cables, causing a risk of electric shock, so be vigilant when you're gardening, and never use appliances in the rain or on wet grass. Outdoor lighting maintenance is one more critical service Lighthouse Outdoor Living® provides its customers.</p>
