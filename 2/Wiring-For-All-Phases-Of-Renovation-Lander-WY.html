<p>Installation electricians, or construction electricians, specialize in installing the electrical systems for newly constructed buildings. Factory, Industrial & Warehouse Lighting: The most dramatic and energy efficient results are seen when STG Electric Services replaces or retrofit older High Bay fixtures with new LED lighting technology. The downside is you have to run extension cords everywhere you want power and you're limited to how many things you can plug in at once (most generators have either two or four outlets).</p>
<p>Moisture can wreak havoc on a home's electrical system and this generally shows at the panels. It is perfectly acceptable to change colors throughout your home, for example satin nickel switches with stainless steel plates in a kitchen, bright red switches on a dramatic accent wall, black outlets in a bathroom with black marble counters or tiling, or pleasing almond electrical wiring devices in a bedroom. Security lighting systems should provide bright light and motion sensors, in consideration of a homeowners' lifestyle.</p>
<p>In addition, electrical panel upgrade can help in reducing your homeowner's insurance bill. Area electrical board members determine percentage requirements. Another level of safety for your home's electrical system is having a grounded wire and grounded outlets. As you might expect, your generator's power output must match your home's electrical requirements. We understand that electrical issues are not only a major inconvenience but can also be potential fire hazards.</p>
