<p>Those who would like to read a book in their backyard at night need adequate lighting to do so. This light goes straight over the chair and makes it possible to see the pages. However, Pioneer Electric cannot completely eliminate the possibility of damage from lightning and other surges. Here are the key features Lipford recommends looking for when shopping for a surge protector. If that is acceptable, you will find the cable leading to the other outlets in the first one that is switched.</p>
<p>Since my new cable only had black and a white (and green ground) wires, I identified the white as hot with black electrical tape.

Many of these fixtures are also dimmable, but not all, so if you're shopping for LED and want to use a dimmer, check on this before you buy (you'll also need to get a special dimmer switch that works with LED lights).</p>
