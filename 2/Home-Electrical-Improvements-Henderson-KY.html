<p>If the same thing occurred with a three-pronged outlet and you plugged something (with three prongs) into the outlet, the ground wire would absorb the shock and take the current into the ground where it can be safely neutralized. You have now installed a new electrical outlet and can take advantage of the safety and convenience of relocating your power needs. Circuit breakers keep tripping: This is an indication your electrical panel may be wearing down and should be replaced.</p>

Electricians passionate about their profession should find numerous opportunities throughout their careers.</p>
