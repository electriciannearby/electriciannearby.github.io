<p>Arc-fault circuit interrupters (AFCIs), installed at the service panel, protect against such dangerous shorts and are now required in new bedroom circuits. How to Become One : Most electricians learn through an apprenticeship, but some start out by attending a technical school. It actually sounds like this is the problem; confusion over what color goes where in those wires from the switch. The hot source wire is removed from the receptacle and spliced to the red wire running to the switch.</p>
<p>Because there's little risk of electric shock, Hart says he likes to turn the lights on while installing low-voltage systems. To keep appliances safe, research the wattage requirements and electrical loads before powering them up through a generator. To do this, you will need to briefly touch together specific pairs of the wires: touch the common wire (typically white or yellow) to the ON wire (typically red) to turn the light ON. Next touch the common wire to the OFF wire (typically black) to turn the light OFF.</p>

That screw is meant to be given a (bare) ground wire attached to the bundle of grounds, if any, back in the electrical box. Upon passing the exam, you would earn your master electrician license. Luckily, your circuit breaker detects when there's too much electrical flow and trips” (breaks the circuit). This price will vary widely depending on the types of fixtures and fittings you choose and the total cost of your project will depend on how many lights you need for your space.</p>
