Breaker: circuit breaker is overcurrent protection that will trip when amp draw from Load or short circuit overheats wire.</p>

Because multiple devices (nodes) are connected, the ground potential at different nodes could be different, which can cause ground currents to flow through "the path of least resistance" via either the common earth ground or the ground wire. The modest expense of an emergency electrician is a small price to pay to keep your home and family safe. When you have a power outage, the generator automatically detects the problem and starts to provide backup power.</p>
