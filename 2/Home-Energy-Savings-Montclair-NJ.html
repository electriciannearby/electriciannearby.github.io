<p>These devices are extremely sensitive to the quality of power.

<p>By purchasing the proper outlet surge protector you are taking a preventive measure that can save you thousands, not only in terms of equipment but in data as well. It's not a huge deal if you mix them up, as it will simply switch to the bottom receptacle being the switched one—you can always switch them back. Be careful not to dislodge any wires from the switch terminals - the wires should still be firmly attached to the screws on the switch holding them in place.</p>

LED lighting is also a great choice because it is much less expensive than traditional incandescent lighting (saves as much as 50% on power usage) and can last much longer as well.</p>
