<p>Test each light fixture for its voltage level with a digital voltage meter (about $25 at Radio Shack). The black wires in the cables are used for connecting switches. Always practice electrical safety when performing any home repairs, and never attempt an electrical repair if you have any doubts about your knowledge or abilities. This indicates there are 4 cables and that one of the black wires is not connected. A no voltage reading locates the trouble in the control circuit; the OL2 is faulty.</p>

A switch doesn't actually use a neutral wire; it simply takes hot” current from one location and either opens or closes the loop back to the device. Each generator must also be matched to an automatic transfer switch (ATS), which serves as the brains of the standby-power system and tells the generator when to kick on and turn off.</p>
