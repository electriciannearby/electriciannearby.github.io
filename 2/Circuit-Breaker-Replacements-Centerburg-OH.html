<p>The outcome of an electrical shock depends on the size of the current, where it passed through the body, and how long the person was exposed to the current. Power strips or extension cords are often used to allow several different electrical items to pull power from one outlet. 1 out of 5 Easy Digging shallow trenches for the low-voltage cable takes some work, but installing the light fixtures is a piece of cake. Even if you're a skilled DIYer, consult with a professional before installing new wiring or electrical appliances.</p>
