<p>Standby generators also have solid steel or aluminum enclosures, good mufflers to reduce noise, and be compliant with all relevant emissions regulations. Your home will lose power during part of the process, but a good electrician will know how to minimize this time. If an appliance falls into a filled tub or sink, or if you touch an electrical appliance with wet hands or while standing in water, you risk severe electrical shock and possibly death. Most generators run on natural gas so they are able to keep working during a power outage.</p>
<p>If a house's electrical panel is not up to date, it will overload and malfunction. There's less flexibility with electrical systems as the lights usually need to be installed in line allowing for the connection of the power cable between lights.

<p>A power surge, which is also called transient voltage, is basically an increase in voltage that's above the normal level of electricity flow. While a surge will not necessarily severely damage or destroy a piece of equipment right on the spot, it can peck on it for a very long time and eventually cause problems serious enough for you to notice. These lights are solar-powered and have an integrated light sensor so they turn on automatically at night and off when the sun comes up in the morning.</p>
<p>Stated simply, DC motors rotate because of the two magnetic fields interacting with each other. Generators offer you power when and where you need it.
