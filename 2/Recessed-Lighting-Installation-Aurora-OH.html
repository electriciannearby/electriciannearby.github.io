A surge protector may be offered very cheap, but that might also be exactly what you get. Generac generators and engines are engineered and built in the USA. At 100,000 hours of expected life, you'll probably never have to change the bulbs in your lifetime, which is good, because you can't really change the bulbs in a lot of these fixtures.</p>
