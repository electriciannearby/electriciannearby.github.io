Power Plus provides varying scopes of service to maintain the uptime and reliability of your switchgear and ATS equipment. The smallest generators produce around 800 watts while large industrial generators can produce 500,000 watts (500 kilowatts, or kW) or more.</p>
<p>This seems conflicting to our brains though… Usually when we think of a source of electricity being closed,” we start to automatically think that this must be a circuit that is receiving no power.
