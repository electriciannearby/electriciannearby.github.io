Most modern appliances could easily overload an outdated electrical panel, which could cause issues for your home. A certified service provider for GE and Generac Generators, we ensure your backup generator is properly installed and maintained year after year. The alternative was aluminum wiring which was plentiful and cheap, but the potential danger it posed was not recognized at the time.</p>

Since a watt (wattage) has been mentioned, this is also important to consider when buying inexpensive home standby generators. One of the most common electrical wiring questions is on how to wire a switch.</p>
<p>Provided that you know how to work on electrical wiring without getting killed by electrocution, you (or your electrician) will open the switch box, carefully pull the switch assembly out enough to inspect for additional wires that may be present, and then use a VOM or DMM or even a simple neon tester to determine what wires are present. We understand that having an electrical issue arise after hours can be very troublesome. The panel white and black wires should never be connected together, although it is common to use a white on the wire going to the switch to splice to the panel black wire.</p>
