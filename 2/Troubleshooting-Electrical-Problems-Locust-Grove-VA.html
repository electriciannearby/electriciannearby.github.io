<h3>The Importance of Lightning Surge Protection in Locust Grove VA</h3>
<p>Sometimes, simply moving a couple of your electricity-producing devices to a different breaker will fix the problem. To ensure that the job is done professionally, you want to know that you're booking a professional electrician, with all the right qualifications. Now that the old fixture is down, you will have already read the directions of your cable track lighting kit and then you will attach the new wires to the fixture that is in place. There are basically two types of generators that can be used in an emergency: portable and permanent standby generators.</p>
<p>On-Line UPS systems use a double power conversion system to produce a pure sine wave output and zero transfer time to battery to provide the highest level of power protection. We specialize in the installation , maintenance , and repair of backup generators for your home. Burglar and fire alarm installation combined with sales, maintenance, or monitoring services-are classified in U.S. Industry 561621 , Security Systems Services (except Locksmiths). The solution is to upgrade your main electrical panel to one that is capable of delivering the power you need.</p>
<p>A lightning bolt that directly strikes a power line in the vicinity of your home can easily over-power even the best consumer-grade surge protectors. This is perhaps not a project which you should do without help from an electrician, but if you have a permit, you can upgrade your power panel on your own. All the electrical circuits in your home are rated to handle a certain amount of electrical flow (amps). The detached service panel, screwdrivers, wire cutters, wire strippers, pliers, and more are items that can potentially touch parts of the service wires and transmit an electric shock to you.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, low-voltage DC wiring (for example, wiring for 12 volts or 24 volts DC) needs to have a bigger wire gauge, not a smaller wire gauge, than 120-volt AC wiring (assuming loads of the same wattage),” Holladay says. Jameson electrical technicians will safely repair or upgrade your home's electric main service panel. Our team of licensed electricians also handle generator repair and maintenance to ensure that your unit is functioning properly at all times.</p>
