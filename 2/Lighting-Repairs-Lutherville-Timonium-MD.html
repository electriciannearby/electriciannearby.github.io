<p>This type of generator is installed permanently at your home (typically in the yard) and is connected directly to the electrical panel of your home. Our surge protection devices (SPDs) and modules are designed to provide protection from transient overvoltage. Make sure all electrical outlets are three-hole, grounded outlets. Similarly, electrical appliances should never be handled with wet hands as this heightens the chance of getting an electric shock.

Not all wall outlets, switches or jacks require you to purchase a separate wall plate. Low voltage outdoor landscape lighting is relatively safe and easy to install.</p>
<p>Standby generators are much more complicated than portable ones and require professional installation as they tie into gas and other utility lines and usually require special permits. The first things you need to know about your house electrical wire are the basics. Whole home generators range anywhere from $3,000 to up to $15,000 depending on the specific unit and fuel source.
