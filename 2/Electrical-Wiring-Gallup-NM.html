Pioneer Electric has lightning arresters on our primary electric lines and we ensure that our system is properly grounded.</p>
<p>Limited - If you have not completed an approved apprenticeship program, you must show three years of experience supervised by a licensed master or limited electrician. Simply put, this method allows easy troubleshooting and insures proper distribution of power across all lighting fixtures. If you would rather keep that protection, install the neutrals just as they were, put a jumper between the GFCI (where the undersink black wire used to be) and the new switch, then put the undersink black to the switch.</p>
