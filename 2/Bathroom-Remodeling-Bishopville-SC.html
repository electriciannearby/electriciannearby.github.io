<p>Browse all surge protection products, including SPDs for industry. Many people in older homes need to upgrade their panels to meet the demand. In some states, electricians can receive both a license and a certification. From our smartphones and tablets that constantly need charging to our televisions, gaming systems, and countless other electronic devices, we are just about always relying on our homes' electrical systems to power the things that are vital in our daily lives.</p>
<p>Usually, a circuit breaker sub panel will service one separate area that has a discrete function, such as a kitchen, shop, office, or addition. And just as before, the neutral wire connects to the silver screw and the ground wire to the green screw. Water conducts electricity much more effectively than solid ground does, which makes that line even more dangerous.
