<p>Spotlighting: We typically highlight one or two of your property's focal points using spotlighting. The president of the Electrical Safety Foundation International explains two campaigns created to save lives. A good flow of information between the customer and the electrical contractor is critical to keep a construction job on schedule and budget. If you experience blown fuses, flickering lights, or simply have an old breaker in need of service, it's time to let a professional take a look.</p>
<p>Down conductors, providing the most direct path possible to move the electrical energy towards the ground. Make sure to shut off the circuit breaker for the outdoor outlet before wiring the low voltage lights. Look for kits that include lights, 100' of low-voltage cable, and a transformer for lowering current flow. Connect the light by clamping the wires to the power cable.

<p>Safety: Allow your residents and visitors to more safely navigate your property at night with a custom outdoor lighting design.
