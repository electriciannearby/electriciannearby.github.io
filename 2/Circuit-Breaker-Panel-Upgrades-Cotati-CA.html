<p>This type of electrical box has fuses that burn out when they become too hot. Also, it has a higher price tag than a gasoline generator costing between $1,900 and $5,000. This system provides control over all the generator's functions, including automatic transfer switch control, start and stop features, weekly testing and exercise functions, and utility monitoring. Low voltage outdoor lights are also less likely to cause hazardous electrical sparks or currents.</p>
