Our approach to the commercial lighting installation, commercial lighting repairs and commercial lighting replacement is different and wholesome. As part of an upgrade to wiring new properties new fuseboards are often offered to enhance the safety of your property.</p>
<p>If you notice a burning smell or see any burn marks near circuit breakers, there is a good chance there was a small fire. Landscape design and lighting is no exception to this. When wiring landscape lights, determining voltage drop is very important so you don't have dim lights at the end of your run. Most of the time, you don't think much about your breaker panel.
