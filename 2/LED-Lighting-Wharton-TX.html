<p>No matter how great your surge protection is, if lightening strikes your house, all bets are off. According to the National Institute for Burn Medicine, more than half of all burn accidents involving infants and children can be prevented by lower water heater settings. The best solution is to put all three white wires, plus an additional one about 6" long, into a wire nut. We are a fully accredited and certified company that performs the necessary electrical work.</p>
<p>It is important to repair or replace old or damaged electrical wiring before it becomes a hazard. Extension cords are intended for temporary use. Because having a grounding wire and grounded (three-pronged) outlets adds an extra level of safety, newer houses and buildings are required to have three-pronged outlets with grounding wires. I do not suggest that you remove the breaker panel cover which will show all the wiring from the circuits, but you could turn the breaker off to a room and remove the cover plates to the light switches and receptacles and loosen the screws that hold them in the electrical box.</p>
<p>Provided that you know how to work on electrical wiring without getting killed by electrocution, you (or your electrician) will open the switch box, carefully pull the switch assembly out enough to inspect for additional wires that may be present, and then use a VOM or DMM or even a simple neon tester to determine what wires are present. We understand that having an electrical issue arise after hours can be very troublesome. The panel white and black wires should never be connected together, although it is common to use a white on the wire going to the switch to splice to the panel black wire.</p>

This article will walk you through how a basic electrical outlet works, and a few different types of outlets you may have in your home.
