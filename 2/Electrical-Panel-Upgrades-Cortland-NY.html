Stephen: I can't imagine why a white wire is spliced to two blacks and folded into the box except to provide power to the switch, but also can't see that it would do any harm to add a pigtail to the blacks and terminate it on the unused brass screw now that you have broken the tab off.</p>
<p>Home generators run on diesel, gasoline, propane or natural gas. From arriving on-time, to our friendly and expert service, you'll appreciate quality electrical workmanship in a manner that puts your needs first.
