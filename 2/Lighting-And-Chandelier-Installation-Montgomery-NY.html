<p>Improper Installation - If your home's breaker panel wasn't installed correctly the first time around, you may be experiencing frequent issues with it. Some surge protectors allow you time enough to shut down your computer without losing data or causing damage. Flickering lights, odd sounds from a fuse box, tripping breakers, and even smoke coming from outlets or outlets with burning smells are all warning signs of an outdated panel. TIP: If the wires to the power source are "plugged" into the back, then you can gently rock the power source back-and-fourth until they come free.</p>
<p>If you have an older home with an electrical system that hasn't been updated, it's a good idea to schedule a general inspection to assess the overall condition of your home's wiring and circuits. In the U.S., electrical contracting is an industry valued at over $171 billion annually, made up of over 70,000 electrical contracting firms employing over 650,000 electrical workers. If your certificate is more than 90 days past the expiration date, you must reapply and take the master electrical examination to reinstate your certificate.</p>
