Stephen: I can't imagine why a white wire is spliced to two blacks and folded into the box except to provide power to the switch, but also can't see that it would do any harm to add a pigtail to the blacks and terminate it on the unused brass screw now that you have broken the tab off.</p>
<p>Applicants applying for a residential electrician's license must present proof of insurance, and: (1) Have four (4) or more years experience in the practice of electrical construction and obtain certification form a residential contractor license holder that the applicant has the experience and knowledge to qualify for the license sought; or (2) Pass the required examination for the particular license sought.

<p>Issues typically present themselves in a variety of ways, including regular popping of breakers, electrical outlets that only work occasionally, and breaker panels that are a discombobulated mess. While the contacts are separating, any electrical energy stored in the inductance of the circuit being disconnected is dissipated as an arc within the switch, prolonging the transition and worsening the heating effect on the contacts.
