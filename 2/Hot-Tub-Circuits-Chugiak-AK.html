<p>A: When contracting with the public and requesting permits, your business must be licensed as an electrical contractor.

Master - If you have not completed an approved apprenticeship program, you must show proof of six years of full-time experience supervised by a licensed master electrician.</p>
<p>Turn the breaker on to test the outlet and, if it works, turn the breaker off and secure the outlet back into the wall. No, not having a ground on the switch won't make the outlet fail to work. Power surges can be caused by lightning strikes or fluctuations in the electrical grid.
