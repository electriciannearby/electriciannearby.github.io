<h3>Different Types of Electrical Services in Aptos CA</h3>
<p>Frequently moving fixtures around can result in damage to the lights themselves. While transfer switches for standby power backup systems are usually automatic, you can also get a manual transfer switch for your generator if you so choose. Our team of skilled electricians can efficiently repair and rewire your light fixtures and test them for proper functionality so you get bright, efficient lighting without any headaches. Our surge protection can help preserve life-saving medical equipment, important data, invaluable electrical systems, and more.</p>
<p>The consumer unit also protects the house's electrical appliances (and eventually you) by having incorporated within it either fuses or circuit breakers which automatically break the circuit if a fault occurs.

Low Voltage Transformers or Transverters are devices used to provide 24VAC power to the low voltage switches & controls in the building. Here's the truth: not all electrical contractors are created equal. Turn off power at your circuit breaker panel, the most important step in connecting an electrical outlet.
