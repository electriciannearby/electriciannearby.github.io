<p>Plated copper wire tinned copper wire is relatively common in older homes, and it looks like aluminum wire. Check that extension cords are correctly rated for the amount of electricity they are to carry and are Underwriter Laboratory (UL) approved.

A rare, but destructive cause of power surges is lightning, but when it strikes, you'll wish you had surge protection.</p>
<p>If you have an older home with an electrical system that hasn't been updated, it's a good idea to schedule a general inspection to assess the overall condition of your home's wiring and circuits.

<p>Power generators have two main components. If they look OK, then you'd use your DMM to see if there's power to them, and, of course, on the motor side of each one. Maintain your whole house generator regularly by having a scheduled maintenance routine to ensure it lasts long enough. To maintain proper polarity when wiring a receptacle, connect the black hot wire to one of the hot bronze-colored terminals. Add a few feet for each fixture so you have some slack and the ability to relocate the fixtures slightly.</p>
<p>Hire an electrician to get it done safety. Effectively, electrical panels need to be replaced once every generation (at least), so if you are undertaking some remodeling or rewiring, it is worth bundling in an electrical panel upgrade.

Upgrading the electrical equipment in your home provides for greater flexibility within your home so you can accomplish more around the house without fear of electrical shock or fire.</p>
