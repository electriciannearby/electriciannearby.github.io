<p>This 12 kW home standby generator can power a home up to 5,500 sq. ft. with a 4-ton air conditioner or other large or small appliances plugged on.

Circuit Breakers have a big advantage over fuses in that if thy are tripped they can be easily reset by simply flipping the switch to the offf position and then back to the on position.
