Journeyperson- to acquire this license, you need to complete an approved apprenticeship program and show proof of General Liability insurance. Because LED lights are energy efficient, they are becoming more and more popular. Journeyman License: 4-year experience as an apprentice electrician is required. Yup, they're definitely not the cheapest in town, but I've used a few other plumbers over the years to try and save money, and inevitably they turned out to be less professional and sometimes downright shady, a few even causing issues that needed further work because of their ineptitude.</p>
