With your new switches connected, carefully push everything back into the electrical boxes.

Electricians train to handle a wide variety of issues with electrical power, lighting and control systems.</p>

Buy a 'single-pole' switch if one switch controls the lights or a 'three-way' if you have two switches controlling the same lights.
