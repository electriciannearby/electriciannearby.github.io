We'll take care of all the details and provide complete lighting solutions that you can enjoy without any hassle. From path lights to step lights to led rope lights and recessed trim lighting, the variety is endless. The transformer can be installed on the side of the house, in a basement or garage or on a post outside.</p>
<p>You can pull on the wires in the wire nut and if it doesn't come off, it is ready to go. Install that dimmer back into the box and put your cover plate back on and now you will have control over your for some reason you go down stairs, and you turn your circuit breaker back on and you come upstairs test the outlet you have just installed and it doesn't work, what you want to do is go back and double check your terminals and make sure the wires that you have installed are tight and in the proper location, and if there are any other wires or wire nuts in that box check them to make sure they are tight, once you have double checked all your connections, you can turn your circuit breaker back on and check you outlet, you should be fine.</p>
<p>Chart on left shows that 30 amp breaker matches 10 gauge copper wire. 1. Not Using A Voltmeter - While the introduction of LED landscape lighting has diminished the need for a voltmeter (because of the wider range of acceptable voltage), having this tool on hand is essential for systems of greater than 10 lights or for systems with wire runs longer than 100 ft. And, is a must-have tool for troubleshooting a system. Solar outdoor lighting systems charge their batteries during the day and produce a low voltage light during the night time hours.</p>
