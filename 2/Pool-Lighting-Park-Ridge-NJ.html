<p>From high-capacity electrical requirements to the demanding needs of 5-star resorts, Tri-City has demonstrated a standard of performance that has positioned the company as the state's leading electrical contractor. This might seem like a no-brainer, but you'd be shocked by how many businesses get burned by non-licensed commercial electricians. At IEC, our mission is to provide your apprentices, journeymen and management with education, training and forums so you can build a team of professionals and excel in the electrical construction industry.</p>
<p>If you are still using the fuse-based electrical system, you need to upgrade the electrical panel with circuit breakers. Electricians must be able to see tiny components, including wires. Also, within the broad CII category, commercial construction is the top money maker at 26.7 percent of revenue, versus 13.6 percent for industrial projects and 8.6 percent for institutional work. In many older homes, the circuitry is hooked into a fuse box as its primary control panel.</p>

We'll measure how much power is being used on the circuits, and we'll thoroughly check the electrical panel to make sure it's safe. If you want to connect a portable generator directly to your house, do not do this on your own. Most modern homes are switching to a 200-amp service to support more high current appliances and lighting. Limited special electricians that work with residential wiring.</p>
