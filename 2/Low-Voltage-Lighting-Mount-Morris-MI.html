Most of the time, this would simply require making sure that the light switch that operates the ceiling fixture, is turned to the off position.</p>

<p>The best and the most affordable option are to go for low voltage cable lighting. From the ceiling junction box, the cable splits off, and travels to each of the other boxes in the circuit. Most low-voltage lighting systems include a transformer that is plugged into a regular outdoor electrical outlet. Make sure that gold and silver screws on the old and new switches correspond. Complete the rough-in phase of the wiring job by connecting the appropriate wires with wire connectors, adding short lengths of wire (pigtails) where they're needed and folding all the wires neatly into the boxes.</p>

<p>Some surge protector manufacturers offer a warranty. Two or more fixtures are then connected to this home run, usually via 25-foot lead wires on the fixtures. Once you have determined your purpose for buying outdoor lights, you can now choose for the type of lighting fixture. Master Electrician: You need to have at least 5 years of experience, equaling 10,000 hours, in commercial, residential, or industrial work. This type of lighting gives less bright light than mains, but it is often still good enough to light up a path, bedding area, or even useful practical light if there are enough lights and they are near enough to where the light is wanted.</p>
