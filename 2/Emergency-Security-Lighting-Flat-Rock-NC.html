<p>This type of electrical box has fuses that burn out when they become too hot. Also, it has a higher price tag than a gasoline generator costing between $1,900 and $5,000. This system provides control over all the generator's functions, including automatic transfer switch control, start and stop features, weekly testing and exercise functions, and utility monitoring. Low voltage outdoor lights are also less likely to cause hazardous electrical sparks or currents.</p>
<p>Usually, a circuit breaker sub panel will service one separate area that has a discrete function, such as a kitchen, shop, office, or addition. And just as before, the neutral wire connects to the silver screw and the ground wire to the green screw. Water conducts electricity much more effectively than solid ground does, which makes that line even more dangerous. The most common type of electrical injury for pets is electrocution from chewing on an electrical cord.</p>
