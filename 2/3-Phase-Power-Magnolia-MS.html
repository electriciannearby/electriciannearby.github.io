The generator's power delivery is sufficient to power whole-house loads, including high-wattage units like electric stoves and air conditioning units.</p>
<p>Do the same with all the black wires (and the additional 6" piece of black wire you cut in step 2). To determine exactly how much you could save with energy efficient lighting, you should begin by looking for an electrician who has experience with retrofitting. We can take care of all of your generator maintenance issues so that you can be certain that your generator will be the critical piece of backup equipment you need for any blackout or emergency. In areas or situations where it is not required, it may not be a bad idea to install power cable inside a sleeve or conduit to protect it from potential damage from future digging or rodents.</p>
