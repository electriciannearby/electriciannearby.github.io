<h3>Electrical Services in Fortville IN and Their Know-How</h3>
<p>When it's time to replace your electrical panel, our services are just a tap away. Older homes' electrical panels often top out at 60 or 100 amps, but most newer homes have 200-amp panels that meet your family's electricity needs now with plenty of room for future growth. The voltage drop in the main power wires from the generation source or the battery to the bus should not exceed 2 percent of the regulated voltage, when the generator is carrying rated current or the battery is being discharged at the 5-minute rate.</p>
<p>Electrical panels are sized in amperes (amps), a unit that measures the flow of electrical current. Buy a 'single-pole' switch if one switch controls the lights or a 'three-way' if you have two switches controlling the same lights. Master Electrician - You must have 2,000 hours of experience working as a licensed journeyman electrician under the supervision of a contracting master electrician. At least 6,000 hours of this experience must be considered commercial or industrial.</p>
<p>And, no one knows generators better than Diamond Electric. Your regular surge protectors are useless in this case and if you have any electrical devices plugged in, they're going to be toast in a split second. Especially if the new electric panel is physically larger than the one being replaced, the original wires may not reach the circuit breakers in the new panel. Electrical service panels have components inside them that are designed to fail: fuses or circuit breakers.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, low-voltage DC wiring (for example, wiring for 12 volts or 24 volts DC) needs to have a bigger wire gauge, not a smaller wire gauge, than 120-volt AC wiring (assuming loads of the same wattage),” Holladay says. Jameson electrical technicians will safely repair or upgrade your home's electric main service panel. Our team of licensed electricians also handle generator repair and maintenance to ensure that your unit is functioning properly at all times.</p>
