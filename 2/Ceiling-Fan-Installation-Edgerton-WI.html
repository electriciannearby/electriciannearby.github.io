The breakers or fuses in your panel regulate that electricity. The transformer is very important when embarking on a lighting project. In this technique, a home run from the transformer is brought to the center fixture of a group that typically uses 12-gauge or larger wire. Before you get ready to install your lights, make sure you have all the tools and accessories required.</p>
<p>Circular saws, drills, power sanders, and other electrically powered tools can deliver nasty shocks or burns Protect yourself by practicing proper electrical safety: Periodically inspect the cords and plugs on all power tools or extension cords, and avoid using any tool if the cord shows signs of fraying, nicks, cuts, cracks, or burns.
