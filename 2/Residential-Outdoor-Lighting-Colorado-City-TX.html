Fuse boxes are rare today and should be replaced with a modern circuit breaker panel. You can, but there is a good chance that the red wire is the switched one.</p>
<p>Circular saws, drills, power sanders, and other electrically powered tools can deliver nasty shocks or burns Protect yourself by practicing proper electrical safety: Periodically inspect the cords and plugs on all power tools or extension cords, and avoid using any tool if the cord shows signs of fraying, nicks, cuts, cracks, or burns. LED or Halogen Systems: As with everything else in lighting, the market is quickly going to LED.

Stephen: I can't imagine why a white wire is spliced to two blacks and folded into the box except to provide power to the switch, but also can't see that it would do any harm to add a pigtail to the blacks and terminate it on the unused brass screw now that you have broken the tab off.</p>
<p>This means that 12-gauge wire will work for your landscape lighting system. Outdoor landscape lights are used to highlight trees, gardens, fountains, walkways and anything else that you want to call attention to.
