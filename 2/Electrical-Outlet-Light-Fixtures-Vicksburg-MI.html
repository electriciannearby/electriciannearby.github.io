<p>Improper Installation - If your home's breaker panel wasn't installed correctly the first time around, you may be experiencing frequent issues with it. Some surge protectors allow you time enough to shut down your computer without losing data or causing damage. Flickering lights, odd sounds from a fuse box, tripping breakers, and even smoke coming from outlets or outlets with burning smells are all warning signs of an outdated panel. TIP: If the wires to the power source are "plugged" into the back, then you can gently rock the power source back-and-fourth until they come free.</p>

Often gardeners, homeowners or landscape maintenance personnel accidentally knock the fixtures out of place as they go about their gardening business, bury the fixtures with mulch or debris, blow leaves on top of the fixtures or otherwise compromise the perfect aiming of the light beams onto their intended subjects.
