<p>Overheating electrical service conductors. Starting with the whole circuit as the problem area, take each noted observation and ask yourself "what does this tell me about the circuit operation?"

As a consequence, circuit breakers are slow acting, and often will not trip with a slight trickle of power to ground.</p>

<p>You can pull on the wires in the wire nut and if it doesn't come off, it is ready to go. Install that dimmer back into the box and put your cover plate back on and now you will have control over your for some reason you go down stairs, and you turn your circuit breaker back on and you come upstairs test the outlet you have just installed and it doesn't work, what you want to do is go back and double check your terminals and make sure the wires that you have installed are tight and in the proper location, and if there are any other wires or wire nuts in that box check them to make sure they are tight, once you have double checked all your connections, you can turn your circuit breaker back on and check you outlet, you should be fine.</p>
<p>We are committed to providing quality electrical services to families and businesses located in the greater Kirkwood area.

<p>Tip: If for some reason you cannot finish connecting the switch or outlet and have to complete it at another time, you can place wire nuts over the ends of the unconnected wires and turn the electricity back on until you have the time to finish the job. Consider having a qualified electrician add more circuits or outlets so you do not have to use extension cords. If you find that your circuits trip regularly, your lights flicker infuriatingly often and the need to unplug the fridge to make your hairdryer work is beginning to get on your nerves, it's time to upgrade your panels.</p>
