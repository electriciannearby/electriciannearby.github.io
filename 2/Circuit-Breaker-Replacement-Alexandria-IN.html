Always use a registered electrician to install new appliances. Shoes - Avoid damp or wet areas when using electrical power tools outdoors.

<p>Provided that you know how to work on electrical wiring without getting killed by electrocution, you (or your electrician) will open the switch box, carefully pull the switch assembly out enough to inspect for additional wires that may be present, and then use a VOM or DMM or even a simple neon tester to determine what wires are present. We understand that having an electrical issue arise after hours can be very troublesome. The panel white and black wires should never be connected together, although it is common to use a white on the wire going to the switch to splice to the panel black wire.</p>
<p>Need more cables and wires. They'll be hidden away during the daytime, but they create a soft glow at night. Neutral wires are never connected to switch. Personally I prefer line voltage fixtures which are wired directly to the house wiring, and are a lot more straight forward to install.

The more power you use, and the longer runtime the generator needs to provide it, the more fuel you need.</p>
