<p>A general rule is that you need 3-5 watts per square foot for essential electricity and 6-14 watts per square foot for whole-house electricity based on the number of appliances you have with high electrical demand. With smart light switches, you can ease the strain on your eyes by slowly bringing up the lights. This helps protect the equipment and can help prevent electric shock. Under Australian law, electrical work that involves fixed wiring is strictly regulated and must almost always be performed by a licensed electrician or electrical contractor.</p>
<p>A good electrician will be able to install a quality home surge protector into your panel. Its size makes it perfect for small and medium-sized homes and it monitors when it's close to overloading so it can stop power supply to unimportant circuits to keep the vital appliances running. Overloading and doubling up of circuits is commonly seen on older outdated fuse panels, the result of improper installations that were never inspected. You can pick one up for a few bucks and use it to test for hot wires or to find a neutral.</p>

Thankfully, it wasn't anything more serious, but it woke you up about electrical safety.</p>
<p>The electric panel is the beating heart of your house and it's where all the electricity flows through from the main power line.
