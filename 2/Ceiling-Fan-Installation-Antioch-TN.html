<p>Portable generators vary in price and size, so it is best to evaluate how you are going to be using your generator before purchasing it. Unlike whole-house generators, you have to manually add fuel to your portable generator before each use. Here in Lake and Porter Counties, where the threat of power outages is year-round, a whole-house generator can prove to be a good investment for your home or commercial property in Crown Point or the surrounding areas.</p>

This isn't too surprising, as being an electrician often means crouching, kneeling and bending to reach the electrical installations you're supposed to be working on.
