The Basic Electrical Wiring Certificate provides fundamental knowledge of electrical wiring and AC and DC circuits. To keep pace with today's fast-growing, innovative business climate, we strive to remain on the cutting edge of electrical installations by using the latest technology.

<p>If you're considering opening an office, here are some basic electrical tips and considerations, along with recommendations on when you may need to hire a licensed electrician handle this job. A common practice is to wrap switch terminals with electrical tape once their wires are connected. This is the preferred method of wiring a half-hot switched outlet, because if the power is coming from the switch, it is most likely a lighting circuit that is intended to operate lights, not outlets.</p>
