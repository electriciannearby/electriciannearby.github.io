You must pass an exam for each license category. Read on to learn more about how to use your electrical system to harness the power of the Internet. Homes with 120-volt service (the typical size) can use an 80kA-rated surge protector as surges over 50kA are unusual. Just like most things in a home, some elements of an electrical system need to be replaced from time to time, and this might include the electrical panel.</p>
