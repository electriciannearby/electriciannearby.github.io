<p>Regardless of what a particular project is going to be, great lighting schemes are a result of a lighting designer that is a master of their medium, since they can meld technology, science, and artistry into one impressive package. If the current panel in your Knoxville home has been in place before you moved in 20 years ago, it might be time for an upgrade. A breaker that continues to trip on its circuit is a good sign that you may be due for a panel upgrade, as your home is not getting the power that it requires.</p>
