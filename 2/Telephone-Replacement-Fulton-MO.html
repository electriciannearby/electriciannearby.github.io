<p>At NUMBER of CIRCUITS in OLD BUILDINGS , use of zip cord or extension cord mounted on or through walls and ceilings to add lighting circuits or receptacles is improper, unsafe (a fire hazard), and is often an indication that the building does not have enough circuits for modern usage. It can instantly use LP gas or natural gas, and you can switch the type of fuel in a heartbeat by a push of a button. Sometimes, a lighting designer or a home owner will want to take advantage of voltage drop.</p>
<p>Whenever we flip a switch, plug in an appliance, or adjust a reading light, we interact with the electrical system in a house.
