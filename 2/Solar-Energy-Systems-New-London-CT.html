<p>If you're considering opening an office, here are some basic electrical tips and considerations, along with recommendations on when you may need to hire a licensed electrician handle this job. A common practice is to wrap switch terminals with electrical tape once their wires are connected. This is the preferred method of wiring a half-hot switched outlet, because if the power is coming from the switch, it is most likely a lighting circuit that is intended to operate lights, not outlets.</p>
<p>6. It's important to size circuit breakers for the wire size they serve. LED fixtures fond of the open air. Low Voltage Transformers or Transverters are devices used to provide 24VAC power to the low voltage switches & controls in the building.
