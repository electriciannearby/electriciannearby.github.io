<p>Call Mr. Electric's certified electricians for a free evaluation. That's because the store you were in has a standby generator, also known as a backup generator. You can get generators in a wide range of sizes, the largest being for massive power plants that can be used for ages and generate huge amounts of electricity, to small domesticated ones that can generate enough power to home or business. Inside your house, you have a complex web of electrical wires just like you do veins in your own body.</p>
<p>With electrical projects such as lighting fixture installation and repairs, there is a risk for shorting out, electrocution and even fire.

<p>In other words - don't continue using an aging, defective electrical panel or cuicut breaker in your home. With your new switches connected, carefully push everything back into the electrical boxes. Or maybe it's something bad, like a new electrical contractor opened up in your town and hired away some of your best people. Don't run extension cords under the rug or carpet.
