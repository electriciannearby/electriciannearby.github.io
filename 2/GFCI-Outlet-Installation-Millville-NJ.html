If you decide that you do not like the way that they look when you are finished, you can always rearrange them because that definitely is one of the advantages of cable track lighting. Many homes built in cities like Dallas and Fort Worth between the 1950s and 1990 may have circuit breakers which may not trip, which poses a serious fire hazard.</p>
