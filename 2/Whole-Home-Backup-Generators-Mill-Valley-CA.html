<p>Carbon monoxide has always been a concern in the safe and protected use of portable industrial generators.

However, they require slightly different wiring than a single switch and are a bit more expensive to replace. If there is, try and add a short piece of black wire to the splice and put the other end onto the upper brass screw.</p>
