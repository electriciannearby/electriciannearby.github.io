Most modern appliances could easily overload an outdated electrical panel, which could cause issues for your home. A certified service provider for GE and Generac Generators, we ensure your backup generator is properly installed and maintained year after year. The alternative was aluminum wiring which was plentiful and cheap, but the potential danger it posed was not recognized at the time.</p>
<p>Upgrading an electrical panel is a serious endeavor that must be handled by a professional; this is not a DIY task. With todays technology, high voltage for landscape lighting is useless. Propane-fueled generators are often smaller than other types, and larger-sized models can be costly to acquire and run. The box with the switch in it thus has a "hot" wire, permanently hot, a neutral and a ground. The location of the switched receptacle is not specified either. We can deliver you the high quality preventative maintenance services you need to have peace of mind in knowing that your home's electrical system is always in the best condition possible.</p>

Always make sure your circuit breakers can handle the load you give them. If you notice an acrid smell from your panel or notice any discolored marks near to the circuit breakers, there is the chance of an electrical fire If you observe signs of a fire, you should immediately look for services to upgrade the electrical panel.</p>
