The bare ground wire—if there is one— is connected to the green grounding screw on the switch. Use a noncontact voltage tester like this to double-check that all wires in a box are dead” after turning off the circuit breaker. Be sure to use ‘earthed' switches and check the electrical load on the switch.</p>
<p>Remove the wall plate covering the existing switch by unscrewing the two screws. Electric current travels from point to point because there is a greater electric potential energy on one end of the wire than there is on the opposite end.
