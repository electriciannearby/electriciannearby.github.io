<p>These fuse boxes worked fine for small homes that didn't use much electricity, but today's electrical usage (with air conditioners, furnaces, and so on) require a higher electrical capacity. The entire fixture is constructed of 100% brass with a removable mounting bracket increasing its uses for small, hard to light spots such as under railings or up-lighting rafters. The outlet has 2 white wires, 2 red wires and 2 black wires attached. These homeowners often don't notice the many advantages of proper lighting until the lights become dim or go out entirely.</p>
<p>Took about 4 days to install - including leveling a 20" grade, building a pad, drilling a brick and 8" thick concrete basement wall, transfer switch installation and gas line installation. While an electrical panel can last for as much as 50 years or more, it's generally considered safe practice to replace it every 25 years. First remove or repair any loose electrical lines.
