<p>When you are connected new wiring to the existing wiring in the home, you should always do so in the last outlet on the run of cable. That said, the best whole house generator is designed to handle the power requirements for an entire home. You will need to find out if you need a new electrical panel, sub panel, or both.

A certified service provider for GE and Generac Generators, we ensure your backup generator is properly installed and maintained year after year.
