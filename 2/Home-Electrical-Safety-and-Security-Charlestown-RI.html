We believe our customer's electrical safety is of the utmost importance and that is why we provide a FREE safety inspection with every service. Some landscape designers can be confusing when discussing angles, colors and placement of the lights. For any extended wiring circuit, always use the same size cable for the continuation.</p>
<p>Our photo (left) shows an electrical receptacle that is being wired to a single circuit. Instead, you want to shop for surge protectors that are built strictly for computer hardware applications. And like all technicians, our licensed electricians are vigorously background checked to ensure you only get the most trusted, best electricians to help you with all your electrical needs. Direct other questions about licensing and examinations directly to the Electrical Administrative Office of the Bureau of Construction Codes.</p>

<p>The Licensed Electrical Contractor must also meet other obligations related to conducting electrical work, including supervision, administration and safety requirements. Choosing the route in which your power cables will be placed is also a critical aspect of a successful wiring layout. Depending on the type of light, how many you need and your current electrical system, prices can vary. This shift is easy to understand when you consider all of the benefits that LED lights have to offer.</p>
