We believe our customer's electrical safety is of the utmost importance and that is why we provide a FREE safety inspection with every service. Some landscape designers can be confusing when discussing angles, colors and placement of the lights. For any extended wiring circuit, always use the same size cable for the continuation.</p>
<p>Our photo (left) shows an electrical receptacle that is being wired to a single circuit. Instead, you want to shop for surge protectors that are built strictly for computer hardware applications.

Depending on the type of light, how many you need and your current electrical system, prices can vary. This shift is easy to understand when you consider all of the benefits that LED lights have to offer.</p>
