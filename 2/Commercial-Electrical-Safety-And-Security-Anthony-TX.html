<h3>Factors to Consider When Hiring Electrical Contractors in Anthony TX</h3>
<p>Installation electricians, or construction electricians, specialize in installing the electrical systems for newly constructed buildings. Factory, Industrial & Warehouse Lighting: The most dramatic and energy efficient results are seen when STG Electric Services replaces or retrofit older High Bay fixtures with new LED lighting technology. The downside is you have to run extension cords everywhere you want power and you're limited to how many things you can plug in at once (most generators have either two or four outlets).</p>
<p>Electrical panels are sized in amperes (amps), a unit that measures the flow of electrical current. Buy a 'single-pole' switch if one switch controls the lights or a 'three-way' if you have two switches controlling the same lights. Master Electrician - You must have 2,000 hours of experience working as a licensed journeyman electrician under the supervision of a contracting master electrician. At least 6,000 hours of this experience must be considered commercial or industrial.</p>
