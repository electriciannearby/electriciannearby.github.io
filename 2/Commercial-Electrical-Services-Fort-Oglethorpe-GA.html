<h3>Professional Landscape Lighting Fort Oglethorpe GA 30742</h3>
<p>With a lifespan nearly 50 times longer and energy use nearly 85 percent lower than incandescent bulbs, LED technology makes for an energy-efficient investment that easily justifies its higher upfront cost.

<h3>Benefits of Hiring an Electrical Contractor in Fort Oglethorpe GA</h3>

Electrician: Show 6 years of work experience, or, show substitute 2 years of experience for completing an approved training course equal to least 576 hours and passing an exam.</p>
<p>Like everything in life, it pays to be prepared in the event of an electrical emergency.

<p>The 100 amp electrical service in your home is insufficient for operating necessary appliances. Part of the current from the black wire will return through the white wire on the red wire GFCI, causing an imbalance in both GFCI's. This connects to the generator so you can plug in appliances without running (potentially risky) extension cords outdoors. The panel was never designed for this and and for that and several other reasons the local utility usually will not allow it.
