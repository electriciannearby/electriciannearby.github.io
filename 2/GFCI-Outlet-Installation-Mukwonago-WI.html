It is recommended to use a higher transformer wattage and larger cable size to allow for adding more lights. Master Electrician - You must have at least four years of experience as a licensed journeyman electrician.

<p>Unscrew these screws then remove the plates covering each switch. This course is designed to familiarize participants with the use of basic troubleshooting procedures to troubleshoot problems in electrical circuits. Unplug unused appliances and stow cords safely out of reach of pets, young children or hazardous situations. Turn the power back on at the circuit breaker.
