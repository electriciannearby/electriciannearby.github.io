<p>Electric panels are used to regulate the flow of electricity for your home while also being the main location of all electrical circuits. Sometimes the wiring at a light box is passing the circuit through to various outlets in the area, so that care must be taken to connect everything back as it was. In this manner, the power must go from the receptacle box to the switch, through the switch and return to the receptacle box and GFI. Lighting repairs are an important because lighting is a part of the look and feel of a New Castle County home.</p>
<p>There are low-voltage lighting power units that are marked For Use with Submersible Fixtures or Submersible Pumps.” In this case, a special transformer is used that complies with the requirements in 680.23 for underwater luminaires installed below the normal water level of the pool.
