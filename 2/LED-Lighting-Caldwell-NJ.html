<p>The electrical plan is determined for a house by a licensed electrician Dallas Texas inspector and the wires are laid. Unless you have extensive electrical knowledge, it is best to leave the installation of pendant lights, accent lighting and overhead lights to professionals Use this guide to get a better understanding of the costs associated with installing a light fixture in your home.

Lighting transformers come in a variety of sizes and you will need one big enough to handle the number and wattage of the light bulbs it will be powering.</p>
