Cords and plugs that show signs of wear or damage need to be replaced. You need to understand that if you decide to install electrical wire you're indeed playing with fire. Consult an electrician, if necessary, to determine the exact size of circuit wiring to be sure that all circuits are properly protected against overloads.</p>
<p>One of the black wires receives power from the service panel; the other sends it on to other loads on the circuit. If you are noticing things like warm outlets or seeing signs of a wiring problem, you may need to quickly turn off your home's electricity.

We service both new construction and existing structures needing electrical repair or being remodeled.</p>
