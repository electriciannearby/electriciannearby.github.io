Our licensed electricians have the experience and knowledge needed to install smoke detectors and make recommendations so that you and your family can feel protected from possible fire hazards.</p>
<p>In addition to electric-specific licenses, several states require electrical contractors to obtain a generic contractor license. Backyard ponds benefit from underwater lights , while in-ground well lights provide an elegant, warm glow. If you are looking for a truly unique track lighting system, our Longmont electricians can help design a customized monorail fixture for you.
