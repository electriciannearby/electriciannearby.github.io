Always practice electrical safety when performing any home repairs, and never attempt an electrical repair if you have any doubts about your knowledge or abilities.

<p>You may want to consider purchasing a battery backup surge protector to safeguard your computer against potential loss of data during a momentary loss of power as a result of an electrical storm or accidental power outage.

<p>All splicing of ground wires and other wires must be completed with approved splicing devices when calling for inspection. Suppose that our voltage check shows that the voltage did not reach the coil when it should have in the sequence of operation of the control circuit. When you're sure the breaker is off, remove the cover plate and unscrew the switch. A plan will insure that you buy the correct amount of materials and fixtures, so don't avoid this one (unless you are only going to be installing one post light and even then you want to know how much wire to buy).</p>
