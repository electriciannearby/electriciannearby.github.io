It's not a huge deal if you mix them up, as it will simply switch to the bottom receptacle being the switched one—you can always switch them back. Be careful not to dislodge any wires from the switch terminals - the wires should still be firmly attached to the screws on the switch holding them in place.</p>

Putting it into easily digestible words, a standby generator works with two major parts: it works with the generator itself and with a transfer switch.
