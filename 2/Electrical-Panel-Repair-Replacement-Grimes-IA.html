If only some of the lights at your home are out, you may not see the point of calling an electrical company. There is also a ton of information on residential LED lighting within the Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) Program for the Evaluation and Analysis of Residential Lighting ( PEARL ). Especially useful is the Solid State Lighting division.</p>
