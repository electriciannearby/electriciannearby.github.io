<p>Issues typically present themselves in a variety of ways, including regular popping of breakers, electrical outlets that only work occasionally, and breaker panels that are a discombobulated mess. While the contacts are separating, any electrical energy stored in the inductance of the circuit being disconnected is dissipated as an arc within the switch, prolonging the transition and worsening the heating effect on the contacts. Since we started, First Choice Electrical LLC's number one goal has always been to provide superior customer service to residential clients.</p>
