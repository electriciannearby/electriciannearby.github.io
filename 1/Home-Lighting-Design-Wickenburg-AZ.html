Recessed lights are installed so that the fixture is unseen.

<p>There is an increasing need for surge protectors because high-powered devices are more sensitive when it comes to voltage spikes. A qualified electrician must be called in to install a transfer switch to plug the generator to the home wiring system. It is not aluminum and it is safe unless, as with any electrical wiring, it has been damaged in some manner.
