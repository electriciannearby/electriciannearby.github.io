GE, a company that started in 1890, manufactures circuit breakers that are bestsellers in the electrical industry. Flickering lights, buzzing and cracking sounds, or corroded wiring have the potential to cause an electrical fire in your home.</p>
<p>Diesel generators are also time tested and have, over the years, also proven them to be very effective and reliable in generating electricity in times of power outages. In the event of an unprecedented occurrence such as a severe thunderstorm or hurricane, electricity is often the first thing to go. When you invest in a whole home generator, you are protecting your home against power surges and blackouts that would otherwise leave you powerless. Another common belief is that if an individual circuit breaker pops or a fuse blows on a regular basis, the service requires upgrading.</p>
