<p>It can also enhance security by increasing the lighting around the outside of your home at night if you choose to install them outdoors. When installing or using your electrical system, there is always the chance of shock. Individuals performing electrical installations or working in the electrical construction trade are required to be certified as electricians or master electricians. Journeyman License: There are numerous municipalities that require journeyman licensing.</p>
<p>Journey Worker Electrician - You must show proof of five years and more than 10,000 hours of experience in residential or commercial wiring. After the first hour, you'll be charged for the actual time it takes the electrician to do the job. This is a sign that the old electrical wiring in your home isn't able to run enough electricity to appliances. Or, proof of 8,000 hours experience as a journeyman with 20 to 50% of the experience being completed in residential work.</p>

<p>Before this change, old wiring colours in the UK for 2-core wire were red = live, black = neutral and earths are either bare or yellow and green, whereas with 3-core cable live = red, blue = neutral, additional = yellow and earth either bare or yellow and green. Be wary of any electrical contractor who agrees to do any major electrical work, such as rewiring a house, without pulling the proper local building permits. A business could end up with an electrician who does not have the experience necessary to meet their electrical needs, or an inexperienced homeowner can end up with a contractor who takes too long and costs too much.</p>

<p>Another term you may come across when shopping for your fixtures is "low voltage" or "line voltage". One of the largest electrical draws in buildings are the lighting systems. Yet, regardless of their core markets, electrical contractors share quite some similar challenges and opportunities. We do Generators better than anyone else, and our pricing and level of service is unbeatable. Like a power strip, it provides extension outlets for your devices but its main job is to minimize the damage caused by random power fluctuations called power surges.</p>

<p>Typically, new circuit breakers and new feed copper wire are some cases we will also change the meter base to allow the power company to install larger feeder wires. Use 14-gauge cable for lighting systems that total 200 watts or less and 12-gauge cable for systems that are more than 200 watts. A specialized engineering analysis may be needed to provide sufficient protection, especially in situations of high lightning risk. Practicality-wise, if a device is able to handle the usual fluctuations in power supply and current flow, you don't need to hook it up to a surge protector.</p>
