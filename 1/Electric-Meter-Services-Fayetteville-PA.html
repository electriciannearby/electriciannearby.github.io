<p>A home surge protector will offer you a guarantee your home and electronics receive respectable protection against any electrical upsurge. Just touch the probes between a hot and a neutral, or between two hot wires. Using the wrong size wiring can increase the risk of fires and other serious electrical problems or result in not enough power going to an outlet or other electrical fixture.
