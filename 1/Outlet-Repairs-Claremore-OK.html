The outlet has 2 white wires, 2 red wires and 2 black wires attached. These homeowners often don't notice the many advantages of proper lighting until the lights become dim or go out entirely.</p>
<p>If you have an older home with an electrical system that hasn't been updated, it's a good idea to schedule a general inspection to assess the overall condition of your home's wiring and circuits. In the U.S., electrical contracting is an industry valued at over $171 billion annually, made up of over 70,000 electrical contracting firms employing over 650,000 electrical workers.

Finally, while there are dimmable fluorescent light bulbs available for some other fixtures, I haven't yet run across any fluorescent under cabinet lights which are dimmable, so if this is important to you, you should probably consider other options instead.
