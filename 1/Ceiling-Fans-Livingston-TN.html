The white (neutral) wire connects to the silver screw, or you place it in the back wire hole on the same side of the device as the silver screw. The white wire is the "neutral" wire, which takes any unused electricity and current and sends them back to the breaker panel.</p>

But when the power goes out and an electrical system fails because of a tripped breaker, faulty wire, or natural disaster, it seems as if everything stops.

<p>Installation electricians, or construction electricians, specialize in installing the electrical systems for newly constructed buildings. Factory, Industrial & Warehouse Lighting: The most dramatic and energy efficient results are seen when STG Electric Services replaces or retrofit older High Bay fixtures with new LED lighting technology. The downside is you have to run extension cords everywhere you want power and you're limited to how many things you can plug in at once (most generators have either two or four outlets).</p>
<p>If you need service on the weekend, after normal office hours, or even on a holiday, the experts at Blind & Sons will provide solutions you can trust. If one-half of a duplex outlet is controlled by a wall switch, then the hot tab, and possibly the neutral tab, will be broken off.

Outdoor lighting brightens walkways and gives your home a safer, more welcoming appearance.</p>
<p>Our technician will work with you to transform your home lighting arrangement to give your home an updated, modern look with LED lights.
