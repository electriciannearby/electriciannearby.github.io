Your Generac home backup generator securely distributes power directly to your home's electrical system. Solution: Check for backstabbed connections by removing a switch or receptacle from its outlet box. For example, one of the most common items added to your electrical system is a ground fault circuit interruptor - or GFCIs for short.</p>
<p>Choose this system if you are using new style GE RS series snap-in electrical devices without a strap and wish to mimic the format of the old style Bryant or General Electric wall plates and light switches. Be sure to carefully read the list of all components included with any generator you're thinking about buying, and price a transfer switch separately if it's not part of the package. When you call our 24 hour number, all calls are answered by licensed electricians.</p>
