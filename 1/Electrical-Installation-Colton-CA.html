<p>Overheating electrical service conductors. Starting with the whole circuit as the problem area, take each noted observation and ask yourself "what does this tell me about the circuit operation?"

The smallest generators produce around 800 watts while large industrial generators can produce 500,000 watts (500 kilowatts, or kW) or more.</p>
<p>This may even be more expensive than your initial light installation costs. Because devices plugged into your outlets are designed to work within specific voltage ranges, a power surge can risk damaging or destroying them.
