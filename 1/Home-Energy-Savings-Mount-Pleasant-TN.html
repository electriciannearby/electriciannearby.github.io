The boxes have labels to tell you what color wires go into each hole. Either unplug some items or call an electrician to discuss your increased electrical needs. Safety: A neutral can be just as dangerous as a hot wire, with the potential to electrocute you or to "ground out" and electrify any metal it comes in contact with.</p>
<p>No touching electrical appliances without permission - this includes kitchen appliances and dad's power tools, which should all be locked away when not in use.
