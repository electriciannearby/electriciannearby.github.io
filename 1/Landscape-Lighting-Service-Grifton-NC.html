<p>If you hear crackling, sizzling, or buzzing noises coming from outlets, switches, or appliances , you could have a serious problem. The rest of the system is designed to safely convey that electrical energy from the lighting strike to ground as efficiently and safely as possible. Standby home generators are permanent.

If only some of the lights at your home are out, you may not see the point of calling an electrical company.

Especially useful is the Solid State Lighting division.</p>
<p>Low-voltage landscape lighting is a simple improvement that can make a huge difference in how your home looks after dusk and in its safety and security as well. So before the next threat of severe storms and power outages, give us a call to get a backup generator installed for your home.

Whether it's a classic crystal chandelier or a contemporary or modern chandelier, they usually install much the same way and add a touch of elegance to your lighting. This leaves only two options: one is to locate all low-voltage landscape lighting at least 10 feet from the pool or fountain edge; or, two, to use a special power supply.</p>
