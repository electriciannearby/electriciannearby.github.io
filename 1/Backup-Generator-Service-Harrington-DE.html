<p>This type of electrical box has fuses that burn out when they become too hot. Also, it has a higher price tag than a gasoline generator costing between $1,900 and $5,000.

Low voltage outdoor lights are also less likely to cause hazardous electrical sparks or currents.</p>
<p>Choose this system if you are using new style GE RS series snap-in electrical devices without a strap and wish to mimic the format of the old style Bryant or General Electric wall plates and light switches. Be sure to carefully read the list of all components included with any generator you're thinking about buying, and price a transfer switch separately if it's not part of the package.
