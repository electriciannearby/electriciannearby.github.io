One interesting thing to note about electrical service panels is, unlike a lot of the appliances you use in your home, service panels slowly decline over several months before they finally stop working. The standard time for lights of this nature to light up is typically five minutes.</p>
<p>The average electrical panel upgrade takes about 8 to 10 hours to complete.

It's not a huge deal if you mix them up, as it will simply switch to the bottom receptacle being the switched one—you can always switch them back. Be careful not to dislodge any wires from the switch terminals - the wires should still be firmly attached to the screws on the switch holding them in place.</p>
