The transformer is where the power gets converted from line voltage to low voltage and needs to be installed somewhere nearby.

<p>Protection of the power line against direct strokes is through a ground wire or protector tube. Buying a portable generator from your local home improvement store and plugging it in may provide some relief, but the only guaranteed way to get the service you need when you need it, is to have your generator professionally installed and maintained by an experienced and reputable service provider. Updated breakers and wiring in your panel will ensure that your home's power needs are met properly and safely.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to speak to your electrical professional about layering the whole-house surge protection, especially if there's an elaborate home entertainment system or other expensive electronic set-up. Just happened to come across this article while looking for some other information of landscape lighting and was drawn in by the clever website name (always good to be handy!) but wanted to point out a couple of small changes that can make a HUGE difference in how long your install will continue to work perfectly, or work at all.</p>
<p>If your home has an electric panel that is more than a generation old, it could be time for an upgrade. The position of the contacts can be verified by visual inspection or by removing power from the system, ('''CAUTION''': Circuit must be locked, tagged, and tried) lifting the leads to the temperature contacts, and using an ohmmeter to verify that the contacts are closed. You can avoid overloading your generator with surges by turning on connected appliances one at a time.</p>
