<p>Whether your outdoor lighting is more functional or for aesthetic purposes, our expert team can help install the perfect lighting fixtures for your unique needs. To make your backyard or garden pop this spring and summer, install some low-voltage lighting to illuminate fences, flower beds, and other features. Step 7: Remove the wire nut connecting the two neutral wires in the back of the box and add a third white wire to the mix. Protect your business, home, or family with an affordable power solution from Innovet Electrical & Heating and Cooling.</p>
