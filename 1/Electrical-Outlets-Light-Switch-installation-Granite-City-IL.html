To start, the wiring from the outlet to the switch does not seem to carry the ground over; I can see it terminated at the end of the sheath right where it comes into the light switch box.</p>
<p>Like cars, standby generators run nonstop for many hours, so they have to be maintained as if they were, well, cars.
