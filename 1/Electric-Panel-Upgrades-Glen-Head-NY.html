When you're sure the breaker is off, remove the cover plate and unscrew the switch. A plan will insure that you buy the correct amount of materials and fixtures, so don't avoid this one (unless you are only going to be installing one post light and even then you want to know how much wire to buy).</p>
<p>If you're considering opening an office, here are some basic electrical tips and considerations, along with recommendations on when you may need to hire a licensed electrician handle this job. A common practice is to wrap switch terminals with electrical tape once their wires are connected.
