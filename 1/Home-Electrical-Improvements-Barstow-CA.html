Homeowners should expect to pay anywhere from $760 to $1,105 for new lighting installation throughout the interior.</p>
<p>In the most basic of terms, when a home backup generator system senses a power outage it will make the automatic transfer in a matter of seconds to ensure that all electrical circuits are powered normally. From 2003 - 2007, 53% of electrical failure home fires involved other known types of equipment.
