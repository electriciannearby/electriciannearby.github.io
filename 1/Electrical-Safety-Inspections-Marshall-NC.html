<p>When it's time to replace your electrical panel, our services are just a tap away. Older homes' electrical panels often top out at 60 or 100 amps, but most newer homes have 200-amp panels that meet your family's electricity needs now with plenty of room for future growth.

Unlike standard lightbulbs, recessed lighting bulbs are concealed within the wall or ceiling, creating a pleasant lighting effect without being noticeable. LED lights are also flexible.
