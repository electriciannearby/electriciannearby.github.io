So before the next threat of severe storms and power outages, give us a call to get a backup generator installed for your home. The Office of Professional and Occupational Regulation wants to make sure that individuals who have military experience and training and who wish to obtain a electricians license receive appropriate credit for their military training and experience.</p>
<p>Applicants applying for a residential electrician's license must present proof of insurance, and: (1) Have four (4) or more years experience in the practice of electrical construction and obtain certification form a residential contractor license holder that the applicant has the experience and knowledge to qualify for the license sought; or (2) Pass the required examination for the particular license sought.

<p>We will help you to decide on whether you should have your outdated fuse panel replaced with a modern Circuit Breaker panel. While they are very different to the typical home consumer, a fuse box serves the same role of a circuit breaker in a building: to prevent the overloading of circuits by cutting off the flow of power and reducing risk of fire.
