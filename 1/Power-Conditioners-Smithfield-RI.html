<p>Lighting Tip: You can run 12-gauge about 100 feet without voltage drop issues as long as the total wattage of the fixtures on the wire is 100 Watts or less. But when the power goes out and an electrical system fails because of a tripped breaker, faulty wire, or natural disaster, it seems as if everything stops. Because electricians must travel to different worksites, local or long distance commuting is often required. All power outlets should be earthed or grounded to prevent electric shocks.</p>
<p>We were founded over 25 years ago with the sole focus of residential electrical services. Another major difference between portable and home standby generators is fuel source. Given that, I'd check the wiring at both switch and outlet. One of the first things to consider when installing a generator in your home is what type of fuel source you want it to run on. When choosing a fuel source, the choice between natural gas and propane often depends on the location of the home.</p>

<p>Both outlets of the same receptacle are controlled by the existing light switch.

<p>Parking Lot Lighting - Parking lot lights are necessary for lighting and security. 5 common mistakes made while installing outdoor lighting.

<p>A lightning bolt that directly strikes a power line in the vicinity of your home can easily over-power even the best consumer-grade surge protectors. This is perhaps not a project which you should do without help from an electrician, but if you have a permit, you can upgrade your power panel on your own. All the electrical circuits in your home are rated to handle a certain amount of electrical flow (amps). The detached service panel, screwdrivers, wire cutters, wire strippers, pliers, and more are items that can potentially touch parts of the service wires and transmit an electric shock to you.</p>
<p>Tip: If for some reason you cannot finish connecting the switch or outlet and have to complete it at another time, you can place wire nuts over the ends of the unconnected wires and turn the electricity back on until you have the time to finish the job. Consider having a qualified electrician add more circuits or outlets so you do not have to use extension cords. If you find that your circuits trip regularly, your lights flicker infuriatingly often and the need to unplug the fridge to make your hairdryer work is beginning to get on your nerves, it's time to upgrade your panels.</p>
