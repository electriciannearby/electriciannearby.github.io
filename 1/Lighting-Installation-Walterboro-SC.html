Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Electrical Safety - Review ESFI recommendations and safety tips before you decide to tackle electrical projects in your home. If you have an electrical issue to deal with around your home, the safest thing you can do is get in touch with the licensed electricians at ABC Home & Commercial. Many homeowners use LED lights in several areas of the home, both inside and out.</p>

The main circuit breaker shuts off the electricity to the house in one move.

<p>Commercial indoor lighting maintenance- Includes regular inspections, fixture cleaning and bulb replacement.

<p>Tip: If for some reason you cannot finish connecting the switch or outlet and have to complete it at another time, you can place wire nuts over the ends of the unconnected wires and turn the electricity back on until you have the time to finish the job. Consider having a qualified electrician add more circuits or outlets so you do not have to use extension cords. If you find that your circuits trip regularly, your lights flicker infuriatingly often and the need to unplug the fridge to make your hairdryer work is beginning to get on your nerves, it's time to upgrade your panels.</p>
