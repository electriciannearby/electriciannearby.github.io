<p>Low voltage lighting systems were originally developed in the 1950's but have mostly been used for landscape lighting and some recessed and cabinetry lighting. Standby systems, as opposed to portable generators, are installed with a measure of permanence, meaning you don't need to store them and that maintenance is simpler. To be sure that lighting is the best it can be in your yard, it's important to do your research. It must be plugged into a GFCI-protected outdoor electrical outlet fitted with a "while-in-use" cover, and oversize plastic box that closes over the power cord.</p>
<p>Most portable models run only on gasoline, though some come equipped to run on a propane tank or natural-gas line and others can be converted with kits. At Arrow Electric, we have over 20 years of experience and an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau, so we know electrical wiring like the back of our hands. Reputable electrical contractors have not only fulfilled the minimum training and experience required for licensing, but they also strive to maintain a high level of professional knowledge and performance throughout their careers.</p>
