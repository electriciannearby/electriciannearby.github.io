It is perfectly acceptable to change colors throughout your home, for example satin nickel switches with stainless steel plates in a kitchen, bright red switches on a dramatic accent wall, black outlets in a bathroom with black marble counters or tiling, or pleasing almond electrical wiring devices in a bedroom.
