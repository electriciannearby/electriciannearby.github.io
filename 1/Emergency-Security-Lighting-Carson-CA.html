<p>Remember to be cautious about troubleshooting such light installations as these bulbs could be lead to potential danger. Power strips — or better yet, surge protectors, which absorb common power surges that can damage electronics — are an inexpensive and safe way to add extra outlets in most circumstances. Typically a standard feature on stationary generators, it's increasingly common on portables. Just one short surge of electricity could lead to the destruction of the electricity supply unit and render your apparatus worthless.</p>
<p>Provided that you know how to work on electrical wiring without getting killed by electrocution, you (or your electrician) will open the switch box, carefully pull the switch assembly out enough to inspect for additional wires that may be present, and then use a VOM or DMM or even a simple neon tester to determine what wires are present. We understand that having an electrical issue arise after hours can be very troublesome. The panel white and black wires should never be connected together, although it is common to use a white on the wire going to the switch to splice to the panel black wire.</p>
