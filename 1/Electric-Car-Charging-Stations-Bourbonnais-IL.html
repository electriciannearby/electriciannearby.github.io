<p>1. Rewire the house with copper wiring. The transformer converts the 120 volts coming from the household line to a usable 12 volts to operate the lights. Experience: Typical experience for an industrial electrician is the installation of process equipment that requires specific knowledge of the manufacturing industry we are in. Wiring in a food processing plant uses different procedures than wiring in a automotive production facility. When a fuse becomes too hot, a piece of wax melts, and every time that wax melts the fuse needs replacement.</p>
