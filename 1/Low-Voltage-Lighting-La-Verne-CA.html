<p>Electric panels are used to regulate the flow of electricity for your home while also being the main location of all electrical circuits. Sometimes the wiring at a light box is passing the circuit through to various outlets in the area, so that care must be taken to connect everything back as it was. In this manner, the power must go from the receptacle box to the switch, through the switch and return to the receptacle box and GFI. Lighting repairs are an important because lighting is a part of the look and feel of a New Castle County home.</p>

Sometimes, a lighting designer or a home owner will want to take advantage of voltage drop.</p>
<p>It is usually controlled by one circuit breaker that is distinguishable from the 110 circuit breakers because it is much larger and is located in a separate circuit breaker box.

It is important to recognize the difference between the two, noting particularly that the relay, serving a secondary role, causes other devices to function, whereas the contactor is the primary unit, doing its work in the main power circuit.</p>
