Diesel powered generators are also common and affordable (though they will typically cost more than Gasoline powered ones).</p>
<p>Fuses are outdated and don't trip like the circuit breakers. Generators help supply homes with a continuous flow of power in the case of an outage, allowing homeowners to still run appliances like air conditioners, security systems, refrigerators, heaters and lights while the power is down. Safety - Simply put, if you aren't completely sure of what you're doing, you shouldn't be doing it. Your home or business's electricity is not something you want to mess with.</p>
