A surge protector may be offered very cheap, but that might also be exactly what you get. Generac generators and engines are engineered and built in the USA. At 100,000 hours of expected life, you'll probably never have to change the bulbs in your lifetime, which is good, because you can't really change the bulbs in a lot of these fixtures.</p>
<p>Those who would like to read a book in their backyard at night need adequate lighting to do so. This light goes straight over the chair and makes it possible to see the pages. However, Pioneer Electric cannot completely eliminate the possibility of damage from lightning and other surges.
