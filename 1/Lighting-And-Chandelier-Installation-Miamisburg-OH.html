<p>Blue Streak technicians are trained to work on all types of lighting fixtures. Outdoor low voltage lighting serves both aesthetic and practical purposes and can provide safety and beauty to your home - and it doesn't have to cost a fortune to install. Without a breaker panel, none of your electronic devices or appliances will work. The first thing that you're going to want to do and this is the most important, is to make sure that the electricity they shut off, to the light fixture that you are about to be working on. Most of the time, this would simply require making sure that the light switch that operates the ceiling fixture, is turned to the off position.</p>
<p>New wiring, connection boxes, electrical panels and even lighting fixtures will all add to the project's cost. That said, you can actually get a limited selection of metal fixtures at the big box stores, just watch for the cheap transformers that may be displayed. Your breaker panel” is made up of individual circuit breakers” that handle the electrical load for each individual circuit.

We have been transforming our clients outdoor lighting design dreams into realities for more than twenty five years. Another downside is that generators fueled by natural gas have a slow kick-in time, and this can cause some interruptions in operations when an outage occurs.</p>
