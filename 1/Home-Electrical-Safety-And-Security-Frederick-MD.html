They should also be able to describe the basic operation of a direct current (DC) motor, a single-phase alternating current (AC) motor, and a three-phase AC motor. ElectricMasters installs copper component load centers (i.e. breaker boxes) that come with a six-year parts and labor warranty and a lifetime manufacturer's warranty on the load center and breakers.</p>
<p>In addition to increasing your safety and security, landscape lighting is designed specifically for your home to highlight the beautiful areas and increase the value of your home. Since 1927, the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) has produced the Canadian Safety Standard for Electrical Installations, which is the basis for provincial electrical codes. The lighting can intimidate possible intruders to avoid trespassing on to your property.
