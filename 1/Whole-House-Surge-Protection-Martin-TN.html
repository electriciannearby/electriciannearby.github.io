Electricians must take precautions to avoid getting hurt. No person may engage in the business of installing, repairing, or maintaining electrical wiring unless the person is licensed as an electrical contractor by the DSPS.

<p>Malfunctioning Electrical Panel: Remember that an electrical panel is the root of your home's electric system. Most landscape architects will include a lighting scheme with their design. When mounting a light switch over a countertop—for example, in an indoor or outdoor kitchen, an art studio, or a craft room—reduce the standard wall mounting height to 40 inches. Narrow beamed lighting that highlights sharp features and wide angled flood lighting to pick up flat surfaces are preferred.</p>
