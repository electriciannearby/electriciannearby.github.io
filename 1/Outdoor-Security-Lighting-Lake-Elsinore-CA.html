<p>Because there's little risk of electric shock, Hart says he likes to turn the lights on while installing low-voltage systems. To keep appliances safe, research the wattage requirements and electrical loads before powering them up through a generator. To do this, you will need to briefly touch together specific pairs of the wires: touch the common wire (typically white or yellow) to the ON wire (typically red) to turn the light ON. Next touch the common wire to the OFF wire (typically black) to turn the light OFF.</p>
<p>This product uses liquid gas or natural propane for fuel. You want the whole house protected from electrical surges so put a system in place to help you minimize the effects of electrical surges. In order to achieve complete customer satisfaction, we target to deliver best in class quality and highest level of services in our industry.

<p>The investment that you will put in to building a wind turbine generator can pay off in as short as a year or less because of the savings you will have on your current electricity bill. Sometimes your transformer will also have a green wire that should be attached to ground”. This grounding wire neutralizes any dangerous electrical current into the ground. A key smart maintenance tip: Hire in a professional electrician annually to check your electrical systems, just as you would get a checkup for your personal health.</p>
