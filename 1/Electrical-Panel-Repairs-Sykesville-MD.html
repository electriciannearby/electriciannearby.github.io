To ensure that the job is done professionally, you want to know that you're booking a professional electrician, with all the right qualifications. Now that the old fixture is down, you will have already read the directions of your cable track lighting kit and then you will attach the new wires to the fixture that is in place.

Luckily, your circuit breaker detects when there's too much electrical flow and tripsâ (breaks the circuit).
