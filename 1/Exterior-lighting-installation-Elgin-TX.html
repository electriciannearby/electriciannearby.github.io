A switch doesn't actually use a neutral wire; it simply takes hot” current from one location and either opens or closes the loop back to the device.

We understand that having an electrical issue arise after hours can be very troublesome. The panel white and black wires should never be connected together, although it is common to use a white on the wire going to the switch to splice to the panel black wire.</p>
