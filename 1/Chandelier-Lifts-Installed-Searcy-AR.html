<p>Note: not all states offer a statewide journeyman electrician license. An electrical contractor can be the bridge between construction and design and actual functionality when you need your appliances and lights flipped back on. You'll eventually need to make several decisions about price, features, electrical capacity and other features, but the biggest overall choice is whether to buy a standby generator, a portable generator or an inverter generator. Commonly used devices for managing this pressure in surge protectors include metal oxide varistors (MOV) and gas discharge arrestors, which allow electrical devices to continue operation while diverting excess energy to grounding wires.</p>
<p>If there is a capped off neutral in the switch box, you can put in a second switch for another light, just as you want to do.
