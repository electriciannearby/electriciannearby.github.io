Fuse boxes are rare today and should be replaced with a modern circuit breaker panel. You can, but there is a good chance that the red wire is the switched one.</p>
<p>With electrical projects such as lighting fixture installation and repairs, there is a risk for shorting out, electrocution and even fire. Our commercial and residential services include air conditioner repair, refrigeration repair, and fire alarm installation to name a few.
