The difference between 2-prong and 3-pronged outlets is that the 3-pronged outlet has a ground.‚Äù Upgrading takes a little more work than just switching the outlet panel. If the lights dim whenever you use a particular outlet, you may be overloading the circuits or wiring.

Now coming to wiring systems again, if you notice only one hot wire along with neutral then you might be getting a power of only 115 volts. At Innovet Electrical & Heating and Cooling, we specialize in installing a wide range of commercial generators to get you back up and running again.</p>

Whole-home surge protectors are installed at your circuit breaker, and they prevent power surges from reaching your electronic equipment.</p>
