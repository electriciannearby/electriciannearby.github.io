Always use a registered electrician to install new appliances. Shoes - Avoid damp or wet areas when using electrical power tools outdoors. Our licensed electricians have the experience and knowledge needed to install smoke detectors and make recommendations so that you and your family can feel protected from possible fire hazards.</p>

Consider having a qualified electrician add more circuits or outlets so you do not have to use extension cords.
