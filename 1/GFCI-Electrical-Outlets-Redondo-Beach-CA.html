<p>A good electrician will be able to install a quality home surge protector into your panel. Its size makes it perfect for small and medium-sized homes and it monitors when it's close to overloading so it can stop power supply to unimportant circuits to keep the vital appliances running.

You can pick one up for a few bucks and use it to test for hot wires or to find a neutral.</p>

These smaller surges can send little pulses of extra electricity to the devices that are plugged into your home and can damage them over time.
