<p>Keeping a decent supply of fuses can become costly over time, as well. Our commitment to timely service doesn't slip outside of office hours. However, that isn't the case with the electrical panel. A journeyman electrician may also work on overhead lines. Your Generac home backup generator securely distributes power directly to your home's electrical system. Solution: Check for backstabbed connections by removing a switch or receptacle from its outlet box. For example, one of the most common items added to your electrical system is a ground fault circuit interruptor - or GFCIs for short.</p>

Safety Warning: Do not attempt to work on your electrical wiring, switches, or outlets unless you are properly trained and equipped to do so. Electrical components in a building can easily cause an electrical shock, burn, or even death.
