You don't just want to go with the first cheap computer surge protector you can find. Low voltage lighting systems usually use LED bulbs because they are energy efficient and draw a small amount of current. However, propane gas or natural gas generators consume more fuel per kilowatt of power produced than diesel generators.</p>
