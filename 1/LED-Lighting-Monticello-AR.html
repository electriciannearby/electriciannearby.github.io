<p>Down conductors, providing the most direct path possible to move the electrical energy towards the ground. Make sure to shut off the circuit breaker for the outdoor outlet before wiring the low voltage lights. Look for kits that include lights, 100' of low-voltage cable, and a transformer for lowering current flow. Connect the light by clamping the wires to the power cable. This is why Penco Electric, Inc., offers generator installation , maintenance and repair services , along with top-quality Generac generator series.</p>
