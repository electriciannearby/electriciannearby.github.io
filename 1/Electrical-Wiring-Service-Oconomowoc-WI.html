The running‚Äù capacity shows the maximum power the system can operate at over extended periods of time, while the starting capacity shows the maximum power the system can get to for a few seconds. It also comes with a 200-amp automatic transfer switch, which switches on the generator when electricity is cut off. There are a few different styles of landscaping lights, too.</p>
<p>You can find many outdoor light fixtures that will enhance these type houses. Safety Warning: Do not attempt to work on your electrical wiring, switches, or outlets unless you are properly trained and equipped to do so. Electrical components in a building can easily cause an electrical shock, burn, or even death.
