We'll take care of all the details and provide complete lighting solutions that you can enjoy without any hassle. From path lights to step lights to led rope lights and recessed trim lighting, the variety is endless. The transformer can be installed on the side of the house, in a basement or garage or on a post outside.</p>
<p>Wolf electricians have the expertise and experience needed to review your current panel and provide you with the best upgrade plan for your home and requirements. Electrical Contractor License: The Department of Community and Economic Development registration is required. Turn off all electrical appliances when you go out.
