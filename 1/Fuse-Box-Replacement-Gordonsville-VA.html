The bare ground wire—if there is one— is connected to the green grounding screw on the switch. Use a noncontact voltage tester like this to double-check that all wires in a box are dead” after turning off the circuit breaker. Be sure to use ‘earthed' switches and check the electrical load on the switch.</p>
<p>They also can be hard wired and permanently installed around the base of water features as well to create permanent lighting. Our surge protectors and filters protect motor drives, contactors, capacitor bank switching and more.
