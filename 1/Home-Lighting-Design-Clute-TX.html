A properly functioning electrical panel is essential to the safety of your family and your home.

Intermittent humming or crackling noises coming from the electrical panel are reasons to call an electrician immediately.</p>

<p>In order to know the gauge of the wire and the circuit information, you'll have to check the cable-sheath labeling. Watch out: if the "hot" wire in your light switch is on a 3-way circuit you may not always have power at your add-on receptacle.
