<p>Examples of accent lighting include track lights and flood lights. Consider decorative lighting such as pendant lights, chandeliers, and wall sconces. Relays only require a momentay pulse of current to change from one state to another - ON to OFF or OFF to ON. These low voltage switches use momentary contact to control the power, so the small-magnitude, low volt current only flows for the length of time that the switch is being pressed.
