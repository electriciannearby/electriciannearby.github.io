Even with an all-LED lighting scheme running on DC circuits, the house would still need conventional 120-volt AC current for appliances and other plug-in devices. The variety of applications is significant as a result, ranging from decorative street lighting, commercial parking lot lighting, car lot lighting, outdoor landscape lighting, architectural lighting, security lighting, and general site lighting.</p>

A GFI is a light duty electrical plug used in bathrooms, kitchens and the exterior of your house. If you decide that you do not like the way that they look when you are finished, you can always rearrange them because that definitely is one of the advantages of cable track lighting. Many homes built in cities like Dallas and Fort Worth between the 1950s and 1990 may have circuit breakers which may not trip, which poses a serious fire hazard.</p>
