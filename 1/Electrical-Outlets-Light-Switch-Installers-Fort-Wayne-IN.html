During an apprenticeship, trainee electricians must complete 144 hours per year of technical training, where they learn about blueprints, safety and first aid practices, electrical code requirements, mathematics, and electrical theory.

Our commercial electricians have specialized experience and knowledge for all commercial electrical application.</p>
<p>As little as a few seconds of a power surge can do irreparable damage. Portable generators should not be connected to the home wiring system. You can also replace fuse box with breaker panel. With the performance and pricing of LED lighting, it is now an option for far more lighting applications. These devices both divert excessive electrical current or stop it from reaching your digital gadgets. Or, use a timer and set it so the lights come on and go off when you want them to. Photocells take advantage of the ambient light and turn the system on when the sun sets.</p>
<p>TPC Trainco provides live training for maintenance personnel in industrial plants and large facilities. This should be handled professionally as it involves permits, building codes, and professional electrical, plumbing and potentially gas line work if your power source is natural gas. When you're pulling power from a source other than a receptacle (such as a light fixture or smoke detector), the new cable and receptacle will need to be arc-fault circuit interrupter ( AFCI ) protected.</p>
