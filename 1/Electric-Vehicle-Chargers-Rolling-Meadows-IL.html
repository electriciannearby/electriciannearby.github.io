A surge protector may be offered very cheap, but that might also be exactly what you get. Generac generators and engines are engineered and built in the USA. At 100,000 hours of expected life, you'll probably never have to change the bulbs in your lifetime, which is good, because you can't really change the bulbs in a lot of these fixtures.</p>

Contact a residential electrician when you want to install, upgrade, or repair the following: home electrical wiring, a new electrical power panel, lighting systems, and major appliances (for example, a Jacuzzi) in your house or condo, which will usually have single-phase electricity. Before your appointment, decide if you want your entire house to have electricity during an outage or if you only want to power specific areas or appliances.</p>
<p>Report any broken poles or trees on the power line or any downed electric lines to NOVEC or the police immediately. The journeyman electrician exam will determine whether or not electrician training has been fruitful. If your house still contains a fuse panel, you should upgrade to a standard breaker panel.

You should check your house for electrical safety at least once every ten years, or if you have recently moved into a new home.
