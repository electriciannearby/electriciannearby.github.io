During a power outage you would plugin your portable generator, start it up, and turn the transfer switch to "generator mode." We can install transfer switches that manage your entire home or just your most important circuits.</p>
<p>If you hear crackling, sizzling, or buzzing noises coming from outlets, switches, or appliances , you could have a serious problem.
