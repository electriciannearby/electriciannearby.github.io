<p>Circuit breakers can be tripped many times without requiring replacement. Licensure and certification requirements vary by state, but typically include passing an exam that covers the National Electric Code, as well as state building codes and regulations.

<p>Keep electric cords out of high-traffic areas. This points to the value an electrician's experience brings to the role. Mr. Electric courteous electricians respect your property and family, providing an attention to every detail that ensures high quality, and secure work.
