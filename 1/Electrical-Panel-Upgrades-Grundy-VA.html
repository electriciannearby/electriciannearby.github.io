Existing buildings will always need upgrades, repairs and maintenance to electrical systems, while new residences need qualified electricians to install wiring and lighting. The meter and electrical surge suppressors protect from outside electrical interference. Lightning isn't the only thing that can damage your expensive electrical equipment.</p>
<p>Good design practices may segregate, for example, low level measurement or signal cables from trays carrying high power branch circuits, to prevent induction of noise into sensitive circuits. You can design your wire route so that it reaches each fixture and then returns to the transformer.
