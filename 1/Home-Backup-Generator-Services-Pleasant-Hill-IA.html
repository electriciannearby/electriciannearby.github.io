<p>These generators are expensive but require less maintenance and burn cleaner. If you are facing continuous power shortage in your house despite of a regular supply from the municipality, you should think of replacing your electrical panel as soon as possible.

Solar spot light fixtures can be used to replace traditional bullet lights for highlighting architectural or garden focal points.

Wiring by owners must comply with the same standards as required of Electrical contractors. With our whole house generator installations, you can have peace of mind knowing that no matter what's happening outside your home, you'll be safe and comfortable indoors.

<p>Issues typically present themselves in a variety of ways, including regular popping of breakers, electrical outlets that only work occasionally, and breaker panels that are a discombobulated mess.
