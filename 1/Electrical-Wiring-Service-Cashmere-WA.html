This 8 kW home standby generator can power large appliances, but also produces clean energy suitable for sensitive electronics, during an outage. Many designers will only create a fixture placement plan when it comes to landscape lighting. With a trusted generator, you'll be covered in case of a power outage. 4. Perform basic circuit checks for shorts, opens and ground faults using a multimeter.</p>
<p>Protection of the power line against direct strokes is through a ground wire or protector tube. Buying a portable generator from your local home improvement store and plugging it in may provide some relief, but the only guaranteed way to get the service you need when you need it, is to have your generator professionally installed and maintained by an experienced and reputable service provider. Updated breakers and wiring in your panel will ensure that your home's power needs are met properly and safely.</p>

Contact a licensed electrical contractor if you have flickering lights, sparks, non-functioning outlets, or need wiring repairs or upgrades. Backup generators provide you with full-time power protection. Adding a circuit will avoid a blown breaker and electrical overload. Electrical Contractor: To qualify, you need to pass an exam, show proof of General Liability insurance and Workers Compensation insurance.</p>
