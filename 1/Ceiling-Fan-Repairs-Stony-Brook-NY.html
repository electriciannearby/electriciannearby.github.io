The thing about generators is that they still need fuel of some sort to generate electricity, and most of these ones that you will be wanting to get only last a few hours, to a day at most, and really don't put out a lot of power. Fuse boxes are rare today and should be replaced with a modern circuit breaker panel. You can, but there is a good chance that the red wire is the switched one.</p>
<p>GFCIs prevent electrical accidents by shutting the power off when an electric current is detected to be flowing through the water.
