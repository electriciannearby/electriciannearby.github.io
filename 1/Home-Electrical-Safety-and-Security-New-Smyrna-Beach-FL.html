<p>It is a good idea to call a professional anytime that you are in need of any type of electrical service. If you have a light fixture repair or installation idea, we have a way to make it work. Troubleshooting and maintenance of AC motors, routine care, dirt and corrosion, lubrication, heat, noise and vibration, insulation.

Other areas that are further enhanced with properly placed lighting include swimming pools, flower gardens and statues in the yard.</p>
<p>We offer generator installation, service, & repair services for diesel generators, gas generators, natural gas generators, propane generators, portable generators, and stand by emergency generators. Or at least, remove the fuse or trip the breaker for the specific circuit you will be working on in the service panel. That's where your circuit breaker is located, and your panel is what houses the wiring and equipment. Your electrical panel has the key job of routing electricity to every room in your home or business.</p>
<p>Our commercial services help you create lighting and environmental designs that make your business look its best. You need to look inside the wall box for wires that are capped off and hidden in the back of the box â€” not the ground wires.

Fixed (standby) generators require the expertise of a seasoned electrician for the installation process.</p>
