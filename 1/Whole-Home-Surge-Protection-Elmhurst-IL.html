It is designed for closer placement near the house as you can have it as close as 18 inches from your house which can cut down on the installation cost. Usually the products having a higher number of joules also have an increased clamping voltage, yielding a larger "let-through" voltage for the appliances or electronics that need protecting.</p>
<p>For example, if you add up the wattages of all your fixtures for a total of 200 Watts then you at least need a transformer with a maximum output of 200 Watts.
