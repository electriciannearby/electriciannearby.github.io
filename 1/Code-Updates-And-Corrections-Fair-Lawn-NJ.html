These types of warning signs could be the start of something a lot more damaging, like an electrical fire or other safety hazards that can affect you and your family. Please note: Surge protection equipment will not protect you or your home against a direct lightning strike. Our team can install and repair most types of outlets and switches, and we stand behind our work with a money-back guarantee.</p>
<p>A lightning bolt that directly strikes a power line in the vicinity of your home can easily over-power even the best consumer-grade surge protectors. This is perhaps not a project which you should do without help from an electrician, but if you have a permit, you can upgrade your power panel on your own. All the electrical circuits in your home are rated to handle a certain amount of electrical flow (amps). The detached service panel, screwdrivers, wire cutters, wire strippers, pliers, and more are items that can potentially touch parts of the service wires and transmit an electric shock to you.</p>

To get the most accurate size panel for your home, we recommend having a professional electrician calculate your home's electrical load. Always make sure your circuit breakers can handle the load you give them. If you notice an acrid smell from your panel or notice any discolored marks near to the circuit breakers, there is the chance of an electrical fire If you observe signs of a fire, you should immediately look for services to upgrade the electrical panel.</p>
