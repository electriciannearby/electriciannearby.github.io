A direct stroke occurs when the lightning hits the power systems directly that the immense potential will cause destruction of the equipment or the facility.</p>
<p>The consumer unit also protects the house's electrical appliances (and eventually you) by having incorporated within it either fuses or circuit breakers which automatically break the circuit if a fault occurs. The 5th step is to wire the lights. As the name suggests, surge protectors are there to protect electronics from blasts of electricity. A low-voltage wiring system in buildings may be used to operate line-voltage lights, receptacles, motors, or other devices.</p>
