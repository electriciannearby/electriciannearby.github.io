Contact a residential electrician when you want to install, upgrade, or repair the following: home electrical wiring, a new electrical power panel, lighting systems, and major appliances (for example, a Jacuzzi) in your house or condo, which will usually have single-phase electricity. Before your appointment, decide if you want your entire house to have electricity during an outage or if you only want to power specific areas or appliances.</p>
