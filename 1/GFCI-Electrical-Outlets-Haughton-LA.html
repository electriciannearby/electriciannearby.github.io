<h3>The Importance of Lightning Surge Protection in Haughton LA</h3>

<p>1. Rewire the house with copper wiring. The transformer converts the 120 volts coming from the household line to a usable 12 volts to operate the lights. Experience: Typical experience for an industrial electrician is the installation of process equipment that requires specific knowledge of the manufacturing industry we are in.
