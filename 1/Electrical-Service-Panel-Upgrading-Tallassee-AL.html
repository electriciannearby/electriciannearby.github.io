<p>Electrical maintenance personnel are responsible for keeping circuit breakers and switchgear working properly and for performing periodic inspections and any necessary repairs. If you are in the process of building a new home, our licensed electrician contractors can help to lay the groundwork for reliable wiring in the early stages.

<p>Not all UL listed SPDs are necessarily rated for use with a lightning protection system. Surges can be caused by birds, small animals, falling trees, or vehicles crashing into power poles, but the most obvious is lightning.
