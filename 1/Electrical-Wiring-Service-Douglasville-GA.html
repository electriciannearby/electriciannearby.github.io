A surge protector may be offered very cheap, but that might also be exactly what you get. Generac generators and engines are engineered and built in the USA. At 100,000 hours of expected life, you'll probably never have to change the bulbs in your lifetime, which is good, because you can't really change the bulbs in a lot of these fixtures.</p>
<p>Never use them with extension cords. Choosing the right emergency electrician can be a very difficult decision to make especially if you are facing a stressful situation. Any electrical contractor that you hire should be technically proficient, reputable, and financially stable, and should demonstrate a thorough understanding of your business. We partner with Kohler backup generators, bringing you an efficient and reliable source of power, perfectly sized to your requirements.</p>
