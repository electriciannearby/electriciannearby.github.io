<p>Down conductors, providing the most direct path possible to move the electrical energy towards the ground. Make sure to shut off the circuit breaker for the outdoor outlet before wiring the low voltage lights. Look for kits that include lights, 100' of low-voltage cable, and a transformer for lowering current flow. Connect the light by clamping the wires to the power cable.

Other causes can be rodent damage to wire, nail in wires, cable staple in wire, or some other wire damage.
