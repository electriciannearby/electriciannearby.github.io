<p>Because there's little risk of electric shock, Hart says he likes to turn the lights on while installing low-voltage systems. To keep appliances safe, research the wattage requirements and electrical loads before powering them up through a generator. To do this, you will need to briefly touch together specific pairs of the wires: touch the common wire (typically white or yellow) to the ON wire (typically red) to turn the light ON. Next touch the common wire to the OFF wire (typically black) to turn the light OFF.</p>

After triggering, the low clamping voltage allows large current surges while limiting heat dissipation in the device. LEDs for outdoor lighting are becoming more available- but be aware that there are significant quality and color temperature differences. Lighting transformers come in a variety of sizes and you will need one big enough to handle the number and wattage of the light bulbs it will be powering.</p>
