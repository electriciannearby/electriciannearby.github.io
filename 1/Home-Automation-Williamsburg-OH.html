<p>If the fuse is fine after reconnecting the main power, plug in a couple of electrical appliances or turn on some lights in the electrical zone controlled by the new fuse. You must pass an exam for each license category. Read on to learn more about how to use your electrical system to harness the power of the Internet. Homes with 120-volt service (the typical size) can use an 80kA-rated surge protector as surges over 50kA are unusual. Just like most things in a home, some elements of an electrical system need to be replaced from time to time, and this might include the electrical panel.</p>
<p>If you travel a lot, consider a small, single-outlet surge protector that can help protect your laptop, phone and other devices that you take on the road. The availability of makes, types and models can be a little intimidating without having a basic understanding of which appliances you want your backup power source to operate effectively. When it comes to electronic devices everyone wants their investments to be protected. According to the NEC , GFCIs are required in bathrooms, kitchens, basements, and garages; and AFCIs are required in many parts of the home and sometimes the entire home, depending on the state you live in. Check with your electrician to see if your home's electrical system is up-to-code.</p>
