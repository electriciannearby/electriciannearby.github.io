<p>Licensed electricians say a breaker box replacement will range from $500 to $3,000 depending on the sie of the house and the type of box. Friendly & Courteous - Our electricians will not swear or smoke in your home. It is basically the brain‚Äù of an electric system, and will have the power to shut off or on electricity to the entire home.

<p>This eliminates the protection grounded cords afford to you. The engine delivers 10,000 watts of power on liquid propane and 9,000 watts on natural gas. Keep the joined white wires separated from the wires off of the switch. Install safety caps and covers over all outlets to keep your kids safe.

Our Virginia Beach electricians are prepared to walk you through and conduct every step of the selection and installation process if you are looking to purchase or replace a generator. Avoid overloading double adapters or power boards with too many appliances as this can cause fires.</p>
