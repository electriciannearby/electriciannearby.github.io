Even a little rain can damage a generator, and you'll end up spending a lot of money to fix it. If you have a standby generator outside the home, you'll want to build a small enclosure around it. If you have a portable generator, which you can move in or out of a garage or some other covered location, you probably just need a cover. Since generators are used in case of emergencies, it's vital that they are installed correctly and are poised to work efficiently.</p>

Some low voltage lights (like many cans and track heads, for instance) have a small transformer built into each fixture, so you just wire things up like regular lights and you can completely forget that they happen to be low voltage fixtures (with the exception of the special dimmer, if you need one). The portable generator, on the other hand, is a gas-powered unit that's mainly used to power specific items like your home appliances.</p>

To enable you to minimize the risk to your appliances and home equipment from possible power surges caused by sudden and unexpected increases in voltage fluctuation, GreyStone Power is offering our SurgeMaster Plus program.
