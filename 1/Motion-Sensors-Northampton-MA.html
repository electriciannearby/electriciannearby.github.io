This course describes Ohm's law; the units in which power is measured; and how to solve for power, voltage, current, and resistance using Ohm's Law. Some surge protectors facilitate you to connect your telephone and the cable line. A third, newer option is a "load-management system," a generator that can power everything in your house, just not all at once.</p>
<p>Choose this system if you are using new style GE RS series snap-in electrical devices without a strap and wish to mimic the format of the old style Bryant or General Electric wall plates and light switches. Be sure to carefully read the list of all components included with any generator you're thinking about buying, and price a transfer switch separately if it's not part of the package. When you call our 24 hour number, all calls are answered by licensed electricians.</p>
