Eco-conscious choices like CFLs (Compact Fluorescent Lightbulbs) and outdoor lights cost more and can run as high as $200 per light. If you are experiencing an electrical overload, an electrician may be able to solve the problem by creating a dedicated circuit for the appliance that needs a lot of power.</p>
<p>We are committed to providing quality electrical services to families and businesses located in the greater Kirkwood area.
