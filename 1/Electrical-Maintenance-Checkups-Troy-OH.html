<p>Whether or not you need to add wiring: If you install a light where no wiring exists, the overall cost of the installation project will increase. The test is pretty easy (I mean electricians need to pass this) and costs about $50. First, only 14 (not 12) gauge wires are to be inserted in the "quick-wire" holes available on the back of many receptacles and switches. I have tried to get several electricians in the past to perform this service for me and either they didn't know how to do it or they quoted an absurd price to avoid the job.</p>
